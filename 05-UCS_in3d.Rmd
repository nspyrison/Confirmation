# How can we extend UCS to 3D? {#ch:UCS_in3d}

Touring involves linear embeddings in typically $d=2$ dimensions. While @nelson_xgobi_1998 and @arms_benefits_1999 have explored the efficacy of 2D vs 3D display, they have done so on 2D embeddings, I will generalize the UCS to scalable dimensions in R, built upon the existing packages *tourr* and *spinifex*. This will allow for the backend work of 3D rotations.

Recently @cordeil_imaxes:_2017 shared immersive data analysis written in C# to be used in conjunction with the 3D compatible game engine Unity. The outcome of this work was refined and generalized in the Immersive Analytics Toolkit (IATK), @cordeil_immersive_2019. 

This future work in an exploratory design extending UCS to 3D projections and integrating the calling R scripts with the existing IATK for a compatible front end to be used across display devices.
