# Literature Review {#ch:litreview}

This chapter contains a summary of the context in which your research is set. 

Imagine you are writing for your fellow PhD students. Topics that are well-known to them do not have to be included here. But things that they may not know about should be included.

Resist the temptation to discuss everything you've read in the last few years. And you are not writing a textbook either. This chapter is meant to provide the background necessary to understand the material in subsequent chapters. Stick to that.

You will need to organize the literature review around themes, and within each theme provide a story explaining the development of ideas to date. In each theme, you should get to the point where your ideas will fit in. But leave your ideas to later chapters. This way it is clear what has been done beforehand, and what new contributions you are making to the research field.

All citations should be done using markdown notation as shown below. This way, your bibliography will be compiled automatically and correctly.


## Touring {#sec:tour}

### Overview

Touring is a linear dimensonality reduction technique that orthagonally projects $p$-space down to $d$-space. Many of these projections are interpolated while varying the rotation of $p$-space and viewed in order to the effect of watching an animation of the lower dimensional embedding changing as $p$-space is manipulated. Shadow puppets offer a useful analogy to aid in conceptualizing touring. Imagine a fixed light source facing a wall. When a hand or puppet is introduced the 3-dimensional object projects a 2-dimensional shadow onto the wall. This is a physical representation of a simple projection, that from $p=3$ down to $d=2$. If the object rotates then the shadow corrispondingly changes. Observers watching only the shadow are functionally watching a 2-dimensional tour as the 3-dimensional object is manipulated.

Each of the original variables assumes some contribution to the resulting embedding, as described by a linear combination of the variables. We call the view of this linear combination on a unit-circle the 'reference frame'. Reference frames 

### History

### Typology

A fundamental aspect of touring is the path of rotation. There are four primary methods of defining such paths[@Buja05]:

- Random choice such as Asimov's grand tour[@Asimov85].
- Precomputed choice, *e.g.* the little tour[@McDonald82].
- Data driven - a guided tour performing (stochastic) gradient descent on some objective function[@Hurley90].
- Manual control, where maniulation variable and vector are selected, a manular tour[@Cook97].
