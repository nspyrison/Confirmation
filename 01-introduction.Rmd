# Introduction {#ch:introduction}

## Exploratory data analysis

The term exploratory data analysis was coined in @tukey_exploratory_1977. Tukey purposefully leaves the term to broadly encompass the phase of exploring, understanding the structure of the data and validating assumptions made by prospective methodology. Data is everywhere and understanding the shape and distribution of the data is an early and fundamental task. Visualization is crucial to a clear understanding of the data. Things can go awry when data is summarized via numeric statistics alone [@anscombe_graphs_1973; @matejka_same_2017]. In these studies, bivariate data have the same summary statistics, while showing obvious red flags that could go completely unheeded if preliminary graphing is foregone. This requirement for visuals also necessitates *human-in-the-loop* analysis.


(ref:matejka17fig-cap) 12 data sets created from the datasaurus, each with the same summary statistics, yet visual peculiarity.

```

It is clear that data-space visualization is needed but becomes complex as data dimensionality increases. Embedding (or projecting) $p-$dimensional data on to a lower, $d$-dimensional subspace is a common dimension reduction approach to visualize multivariate data spaces. Traditionally single static projection is used to summarize a space, which necessarily shows a subset of the variation of the data. @asimov_grand_1985 suggested the use of viewing projections dynamically across a changing projection basis allows for more variation to be contained and viewed temporally. This dynamic view of many changing projections is known as *tours*. While, there are different methods of generating tour paths, human-in-the-loop user-controlled steering (UCS) offers the finest control for navigating local structure and is particularly useful in exploration after an interesting feature has been identified.

Hardware improvement has made VR more affordable and available to wider audiences, at ever increasing resolutions of display. The literature points to improved perception when viewing multivariate data in 3D VR as compared with traditional 2D monitors. Yet tours are often viewed on 2D monitors while the selected geometric display dictates the dimensionality of graphic, $d=\{1, 2, p\}$. With the exception @nelson_xgobi_1998, where $d=2$ tours were viewed in 3D head-tracked VR. Bringing dynamic projections and UCS into VR should improve perception of $d=2$ embeddings, allow for more accurate and intuitive perception of 3D surfaces, and enable dynamic projections $d=3$ spaces.

 
## Research objectives

Data and models are typically high-dimensional, with many variables or parameters. Developing new methods to visualize high dimensions have been a pursuit of statisticians, computer scientists and visualization researchers for decades. As technology evolves examining, extending, and assessing current techniques, in new environments, for new data challenges, is an important endeavor. The primary goal of this PhD research can then be summarized as:

**Research objectives (RO):**

1. **How can UCS be implemented in 1- and 2D projections?** (Completed work, chapter \ref{ch:completed_work}.) Following the theory laid out in @cook_manual_1997 this work enables manual tours for fine control in exploring the local area of interesting features. Previous implementations are no longer compiling.
<!-- User-controlled steering of dynamic projections allows for the user to select which and how a specific variable should be rotated. This is completed work following the research of @cook_manual_1997. I have implemented UCS in 1- and 2D and built an extensible platform for projection into $d>2$ spaces. -->
2. **Does 2D UCS provide benefits over alternatives?** (Future work, chapter \ref{ch:future_work}.) This objective compares the effectiveness of dynamic linear projection and UCS against commonly used alternatives of static linear and static non-linear projections.
<!-- *Case study* comparing dynamic, UCS projections with commonly used static alternatives. -->
3. **How can UCS be extended to 3D?** (Future work, chapter \ref{ch:future_work}.) 
 Bringing dynamic projections into 3D not only allows for more accurate and precise interpretation of $d=2$ projections, but also for the projection of $d=3$ scatterplots and surfaces.
<!-- This *experimental design* will be novel work in extending dynamic projections, including UCS, to 3D. The work done in RO 1 will be used in conjunction with @cordeil_immersive_2019 to form an UI compatible across display devices. -->
4. **Does UCS in 3D displays provide perception benefits over 2D displays?** (Future work, chapter \ref{ch:future_work}.) This objective tests the efficacy of dynamic projections as compared across various display devices.
<!-- *Empirical study* exploring the efficacy of bringing UCS into 3D as compared across various display devices. -->

## Methodology

RO #1 is completed **applied research** following work in @cook_manual_1997 to allow for UCS. This outcome of this is an *R* package, `spinifex`, which will be submitted to to CRAN and for hosting and distribution. This forms the foundation for future work in the remaining objectives. 

The second objective is a **case study** comparison between dynamic linear projections and alternatives (static linear and static non-linear projections such as Principal Component Analysis, Multi-Dimensional Scaling, and t-distributed neighbor embeddings, described in more detail in chapter \ref{ch:future_work}). Measures comparing between the techniques will include: variation explained, transparency to the original variable space, clustering, and outlier identification.

RO #3 involves **experimental design** applying contribution from RO #1 with the immersive analytics toolkit (IATK) in @cordeil_immersive_2019, an extensible toolkit for visualizing data in VR. First the work from RO # 1 will be extend into $d=3$ projections an surface projections. This will be called from the IATK and used for a standardized interface across display devices.

The response to RO #4 is a *randomized full factorial design* **empirical study** to explore the efficacy of bringing UCS into 3D as compared across various display devices. In this design every participant will complete every task on every display device. Quantitative measurements include participant speed and accuracy of tasks, biometric readings, and subjective Likert survey of participants. A lineup-type model as outlined in @hofmann_graphical_2012 may also be employed for assessing quality of display types.

In this report, the related literature is discussed in chapter \ref{ch:lit_review}. A brief overview of the research is given in chapter \ref{ch:projectoverview}, followed by the completed work and future work in chapters \ref{ch:completed_work} and \ref{ch:future_work} respectively. A prospective timeline is listed in chapter \ref{ch:timeline}. Notation for dynamic touring and VR data visualization can be found in appendix \ref{ch:glossary}, and an excerpt of a paper to be submitted to the R Journal can be found in appendix \ref{ch:spinifex_paper}.


## Workflow and reproduction

Figure \ref{dataanalysisworkflow} depicts general data analysis workflow [@wickham_r_2016]. Where data first must be imported into a tool, the structure of the data must be tidied and ordered neatly into the correct use format. After the data enters a repeating cycle, where values maybe transformed, visualized, and modeled with communication going to the appropriate recipients. 

(ref:dataanalysisworkflow-cap) Data analysis workflow [@wickham_r_2016]. This research aids visualization in exploratory data analysis and in the workflow.

```

The programing language, *R*, is used in the work described below to import, tidy, and transform data. It can be use directly to visualize 2D tour (RO #1 & 2) or be consumed into the game engine *Unity* to visualize 3D tours (RO #3 & 4). Doing analysis and writeup in such programmatic ways allow work to be done reproducibly. All work completed and discussed is done with reproduction principles in mind, where data, analysis, and code are stored in the same directory in order to make the work as transparent and reproducible as possible. Transparency and reproduction of work is a key feature to a mature analysis workflow as they validate and defend the claims and methodology held within a work. Directories of completed and planned work are hosted publicly on GitHub, including this report. Accessing the source files for this report is discussed in section \ref{sec:source}.



<!-- TODO: move this to tours lit rev. -->
<!-- This thesis focuses on tour methods for visualizing high-dimensional data. Tours are a family of algorithms for generating paths on the space of low-dimensional ($d=1, 2, 3, ..., p$) projections of high-dimensional ($p$) space. The resulting projection of the data (or model) is displayed using low-dimensional techniques such as histograms, dot plots, scatterplots, or parallel coordinate plots, and the path generates a movie or animation to shows many low-dimensional projections. The method can be applied with other techniques such as machine learning techniques like discriminant analysis, neural networks, support vector machines, to open the black box, and complements dimension reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (MDS) on nonlinear embeddings (e.g. tSNE).  -->
