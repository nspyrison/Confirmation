## Setup and & requirements

To run this template you need `bookdown` and LaTeX:

```r
install.packages('bookdown')
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

To run my code inline you will also need atleast `spinifex` and potentially other packages that relate to touring:

```r
devtools::install_github("nspyrison/spinifex")
```

## Acknowledgements & Thanks {#sec:acknowledgements}

This thesis and milstone reports were created in `R` (R Core Team, 2019) using `rmarkdown` (Xie, 2018) and `bookdown` following Rob Hyndman's [MonashThesis](github.com/robjhyndman/MonashThesis) (Hyndman, 2019) Rmarkdown template. Slides are produced using `xaringan` (Xie, 2020).
