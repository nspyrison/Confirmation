Confirmation presentation: https://github.com/nspyrison/confirmation_talk 


Built with thanks from Rob's EBS template: https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashThesis


## Requirements

You will need to install `spinifex` to compile manual tours:

```r
devtools::install_github("nspyrison/spinifex")
```

__ PhD template setup:
To set up the software, you will need to install the `bookdown` package and its dependencies as follows:

```r
install.packages('bookdown')
```

You will also need LaTeX installed. If you don't already have LaTeX, one convenient approach is to install it via R:

```r
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
