# What benefit does UCS have over popular alternatives? {#ch:UCS_benefits}

High dimensional data and models are ubiquitous but viewing them in data space is not trivial. Currently it is common practice to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), or a non-linear embedding like tSNE. Unfortunately, static projections necessarily cut variation in the components not shown, while non-linear techniques lose transparency back to the original variable-space. Touring preserves transparency to variable-space and keeps variation in tack. By providing user-controlled steering of tour we should be able to provide finer structural exploration than the alternatives.

In this future work I plan to perform a case study between UCS leading alternatives. Design space includes data sets, studies, and measures of comparison.
