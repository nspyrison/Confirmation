# Human-computer interaction with displays of high dimensional data and functions {#ch:hci}

tie to manual tours, and 2d tours, and bring into 3d. and function projections

applied to physics data.

Data analysis in VR spaces, so called immerse analytics, is becoming more and more popular, yet with mixed and varied results (@marriott_immersive_2018). The Immerse Analytics group at Monash University have been programming packages in C#, for use with the Unity game engine for such uses (@cordeil_imaxes:_2017, @cordeil_immersive_2019). I will build upon this framework and implement dynamic communication with R scripts to apply touring and other dimensionality reduction methods in Unity.
