\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}

This is where you introduce the main ideas of your thesis, and an
overview of the context and background.

In a PhD, Chapter 2 would normally contain a literature review.
Typically, Chapters 3--5 would contain your own contributions. Think of
each of these as potential papers to be submitted to journals. Finally,
Chapter 6 provides some concluding remarks, discussion, ideas for future
research, and so on. Appendixes can contain additional material that
don't fit into any chapters, but that you want to put on record. For
example, additional tables, output, etc.

\section{Touring}\label{sec:tour}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview}

In univariate datasets histograms, or smoothed density curves are
employed to visualize data. In bivariate data scatterplots and contour
plots (2-d density) can be employed. In three dimensions the two most
common techniques are: 2-d scatter plot with the 3rd variable as an
aesthetic (such as, color, size, height, \(etc.\)) or rendering the data
in a 3-d volume using some perceptive cues giving information describing
the seeming depth of the image
\footnote{Graphs of data depicting 3 dimension are typically printed on paper, or rendered on a 2-d monitor, they are intrinsically 2-d images. They are sometimes referred to as 2.5-d, or more frequently erroneously referred to as 3-d, more on this later.}.
When there are 4 variables: 3 variables as spatial-dimensions and a 4th
as aesthetic, or a scatterplot matrix consisting of 4 histograms, and 6
unique combinations of bivariate scatterplots.

Let \(p\) be the number of numeric variables; how do we visualize data
for even modest values of \(p\) (say 6 or 12)? It's far too common that
visualizing in data-space is dropped altogether in favor of modeling
parameter-space, model-space, or worse, long tables of statistics
without visuals\autocite{wickham_visualizing_2015}. Yet, we all know of
the risks and possible mis-leadingness of relying too heavily on
parameters alone\autocites{anscombe_graphs_1973}{matejka_same_2017}. So
why do we get aware from visualizing in data-space? Scalability, in a
word, we are not familiar with methods that allow us to concisely depict
and digest \(p \geq 5\) or so dimensions. This is where touring comes
in; using the wide range of touring techniques we are able to preserve
the visualization of data-space, and the intrinsic understanding of
structure and the data, beyond looking at statistic values alone.

Touring is a linear dimensonality reduction technique that orthagonally
projects \(p\)-space down to \(d\)-space. Many of these projections are
interpolated while varying the rotation of \(p\)-space and viewed in
order to the effect of watching an animation of the lower dimensional
embedding changing as \(p\)-space is manipulated. Shadow puppets offer a
useful analogy to aid in conceptualizing touring. Imagine a fixed light
source facing a wall. When a hand or puppet is introduced the
3-dimensional object projects a 2-dimensional shadow onto the wall. This
is a physical representation of a simple projection, that from \(p=3\)
down to \(d=2\). If the object rotates then the shadow correspondingly
changes. Observers watching only the shadow are functionally watching a
2-dimensional tour as the 3-dimensional object is manipulated.

\subsection{History}\label{history}

In 1974 Friedman and Tukey purposed Projection
Pursuit\autocite{friedman_projection_1974} (sometimes referred to as PP)
while working at Bell Labs. Projection Pursuit involves identifying
``interesting'' projection, remove a single component of the data, and
then iterate in this newly embedded subspace. Within each subspace the
projection seeks for a local extrema via gradient descent (historically
referred to as hill climbing algorithms), hence the nomenclature
pursuit.

Touring was first introduced by Asimov in 1985 with his purposed Grand
Tour\autocite{asimov_grand_1985} at Stanford University. In which,
Asimov suggested three types of Grand Tours: torus, at-random, and
random-walk. The specifics of which will be discussed below in the
Typology section.

\ldots{}

\subsection{Typology}\label{typology}

\subsubsection{Movement}\label{movement}

A fundamental aspect of touring is the path of rotation. There are four
primary methods of defining such
paths\autocite{buja_computational_2005}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Random choice such as Asimov's grand tour\autocite{asimov_grand_1985}.
\item
  Precomputed choice, \emph{e.g.} the little
  tour\autocite{mcdonald_interactive_1982}.
\item
  Data driven - a guided tour performing (stochastic) gradient descent
  on some objective function\autocite{hurley_analyzing_1990}.
\item
  Manual control, a constrained rotation on selected manipulation
  variable and magnitude\autocite{cook_manual_1997}.
\end{itemize}

\ldots{} - torus: where a \(p\)-dimensional torus, \(T^p\) is created
from a Cartesian product of \(p\) unit circles with
\(T^p \in \mathbb{R}^p\). Unfortunately uniformity of the parameters do
not correlate to uniform points on the surface of the torus. If step
distance between frames is fixed, disproportionate time is spent between
subspaces. If step distance is change to account for uniform points on
the torus then the continuity of the tour is lost.\\
- at-random: where each 2-frame is chosen at random without replacement.
This affords an assured uniform distribution of subspaces, but is far to
discontinuous for observation. It also leaves no parameters to control.
- random-walk: combines the continuity of the torus method and the
uniformity of the at-random method while leaving room for a control
parameter.

\subsubsection{Geoms}\label{geoms}

Scatterplots offer a simple, general case for viewing lower-dimension
embeddings of higher-dimensions. Such visualization offer \(p\)-dim down
to \(d\)-dim, typically two in the case of a standard monitor. Yet, no
intrinsic value stops touring being used in other graphics or geoms
(geometrics). For instance using parallel coordinate plots
(PCP){[}@\ldots{}{]}, Andrews plots {[}@\ldots{}{]}, Chernoff faces
{[}@\ldots{}{]}, all offer perfectly valid graphs in \(p\)-dimensions.
these can also be toured.

This works well when the number of dimensions being toured is small (in
the neighborhood of 5-10), yet the number of view, or 2-frames and we
can produce from \(p\)-space suffers from the so called blessing/curse
of dimensionality. In which the plethora of degrees of freedom either
offer many (non-unique) solutions to a problem or something that becomes
ever increasing unlikely, \(ie.\) a bivariate square needs .
