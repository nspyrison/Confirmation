\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

Visualizing data space is crucial to exploratory and general data
analysis yet doing so quickly becomes difficult as the dimensionality of
the data increases. Traditionally, static, low-dimensional linear
embeddings are used to identify clustering, outliers, and structure.
Observing one such embedding often misses a significant amount of
variation, and hence, information held within the data. \emph{Tours} are
a class of dynamic linear projections that animates many linear
projections as the orientation in data space changes. User-controlled
steering (UCS) of the original dimensionality offers fine control of the
local structure of projections.

Data visualization has lagged behind in utilizing 3D and virtual spaces
after the overhype of the 1980s and '90s gave way to some unpromising
results. Modern mixed reality hardware has significantly improved the
quality and simultaniously reduced the barrier to entry. Contemporary
studies have regularly shown increased accuracy of perception of visuals
displayed in 3D over 2D, including in projected subspaces. It's time to
further explore dynamic projections in virtual spaces.

Multivariate data is ubiquitous and viewing it in data-space is a
crucial aspect of data analysis and consumption. This research is
four-fold and allows for fine exploration of the data structure in
embeddings of high dimensional spaces, contrasts UCS with traditional
static techniques, extends UCS \& creates surface projections in 3D
space, and quantifies the benefits of dynamic projections across display
devices.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

\section{Exploratory data analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}

The term exploratory data analysis was coined in
\textcite{tukey_exploratory_1977}, who leaves it as a broad term to
encompass the initial summarization and visualization of a data set.
This is a critical first step of checking for realistic values and
validating assumptions made by prospective methodology. Visualization is
crucial to a clear understanding of the data. Things can go awry when
data is summarized via numeric statistics alone
\autocite{anscombe_graphs_1973} as demonstrated in figure
\ref{fig:matejka17fig} \autocite{matejka_same_2017}. In these studies,
bivariate data have the same summary statistics (such as mean and
standard deviation), yet contains obvious visual trends and shapes that
could go completely unheeded if plotting is foregone. Because there are
inherent dangers to relying on statistics alone, this requirement for
looking at visuals necessitates \emph{human-in-the-loop} analysis,
defined as any model that requires human interaction
\autocite{karwowski_international_2006}.






\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./figures/matejka17fig} 

}

\caption{12 data sets created from the datasaurus by
simulated annealing. Each is restrained to the same summary statistics
but given shapes with visual peculiarity to mutate into
\autocite{matejka_same_2017}.}\label{fig:matejka17fig}
\end{figure}

It is clear that data-space visualization is needed but it becomes
complex as data dimensionality increases. Embedding (or projecting)
\(p-\)dimensional data on to a lower, \(d\)-dimensional subspace is a
common dimension reduction approach to visualize multivariate data
spaces. Traditionally a single static projection is used to summarize a
space, which necessarily shows a subset of the variation of the data.
\textcite{asimov_grand_1985} suggested the use of viewing projections
dynamically across a changing projection basis allows for more variation
to be contained and viewed temporally. This dynamic view of many
changing projections is known as \emph{tours}. While, there are
different methods of generating tour paths, human-in-the-loop
user-controlled steering (UCS) offers the finest control for navigating
the local structure.

Tours are typically viewed from standard 2D monitors, and most commonly
viewed as a projection down to 2D. A notable exception being
\textcite{nelson_xgobi_1998}, where 3D embeddings were viewed in 3D
head-tracked VR. Data visualization studies generally show benefits in
3D visuals over 2D, especially when adequate depth cues are provided.
The state of modern hardware has made VR more affordable and available
to wider audiences, at ever increasing resolutions of display than
previously possible. It is therefore timely for research to be conducted
to compare the structure and speed of comprehension of dynamic linear
projections across 2- and 3D display devices.

\section{Research objectives}\label{research-objectives}

Data and models are typically high-dimensional, with many variables and
parameters. Developing new methods to visualize high dimensions has been
a pursuit of statisticians, computer scientists and visualization
researchers for decades. As technology evolves examining, extending, and
assessing current techniques, in new environments, for new data
challenges, is an important endeavor. The primary objectives of this
Ph.D.~research can then be summarized as the following.

\textbf{Research objectives (RO):}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{How can UCS be generalized to work within various graphic
  environment for 2D projections?}\\
  (Work in progress, chapter \ref{ch:workinprogress}.)\\
  The UCS algorithm in \textcite{cook_manual_1997} is designed for a
  specific animation package. The algorithm should be generalized to
  extend use to work with various graphics environments. This enables
  fine control of exploring the local structure of data in 2D embeddings
  and sets the foundation to be used in the remaining objectives.
\item
  \textbf{Does 2D UCS tours provide benefits over alternatives?}\\
  (Future work, chapter \ref{ch:future_work}.)\\
  The quality and effectiveness of 2D UCS will be compared with
  alternatives of static, single, linear and non-linear projection
  techniques. They will be quantified by the measurement of structure,
  variation, and clustering across on benchmark datasets.
\item
  \textbf{How can UCS be extended to 3D?}\\
  (Future work, chapter \ref{ch:future_work}.)\\
  The addition of a 3rd dimension potentially allows for the improved
  perception of the structure of the data. To investigate this UCS
  algorithm needs to be extended to a third dimension and the rendering
  of 3D dynamic projections and sectioning for use across mixed reality
  display devices. This will involve the addition of a new angle and it
  controls to the projection space, reference frame, and manipulation
  space. In particular, the manipulation space, now in 4D, will be hard
  to visualize but should be able to interact with via a point on the
  now 3D reference frame.
\item
  \textbf{Does UCS in 3D displays provide benefits over 2D displays?}\\
  (Future work, chapter \ref{ch:future_work}.)\\
  The addition of a 3rd dimension has previously been shown to provide
  benefits. The extension of UCS into 3D should be used to explore the
  potential benefits of UCS projections as well. Interactive,
  time-varying tours theoretically allow for improved understanding and
  comprehension speed of the structure of the data. These metrics will
  be measured across display device (including a 2D standard monitor, 3D
  head tracked monitor, and 3D head-mounted display).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Contributions:}

The intended contributions and scope of this research can be summarized
as:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A modified UCS algorithm and new implementation applied to
  contemporary high energy physics and astrophysics applications in 2D
  animation frameworks.
\item
  A performance comparison of static and interactive UCS projection
  techniques assessed on benchmark data sets from the recent literature.
\item
  A new algorithm for UCS in 3D. With new applications to function
  visualization in 3D.
\item
  Quantitative understanding of the relative benefits of UCS across 2-
  and 3D display devices.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}

This research is interdisciplinary; it stems from a linear dimension
reduction technique developed by statisticians and extended with
information technology into 3D including VR technologies, with
applications in high energy physics
identified\autocite{cook_dynamical_2018}. Experts in these fields
correspondingly supervise the research.

The research corresponding with RO \#1 entails a work in progress
\textbf{algorithm design} following the work in
\textcite{cook_manual_1997}. The proposed algorithm discusses the
generalized application of UCS for use across animation-specific
frameworks. The outcome of this is an \emph{R} package,
\texttt{spinifex}, which will be submitted to CRAN and for hosting and
distribution. This forms the foundation for future work in the remaining
objectives.

The second objective is addressed with a benchmark dataset comparison
\textbf{case study} between dynamic linear projections and alternatives
(static linear and static non-linear projections such as principal
component analysis, multi-dimensional scaling, and t-distributed
neighbor embeddings, described in more detail in chapter
\ref{ch:future_work}). Benchmark datasets will be compared across
techniques, measurements will include variation explained, transparency
to the original variable space, clustering identification, and outlier
identification.

The research for RO \#3 involves \textbf{algorithm design}, where the
work in RO \#1 will be extended to display with the use of a third
spatial dimension. Surface and function projections will also be
developed. This forms the calculation base for the work. Several
difficulties may arise when bringing dynamic projection into 3D spaces,
especially when exploring 3D surfaces (discussed in more detail in
chapter \ref{ch:future_work}).

The research resulting from RO \#4 is a controlled \textbf{usability
study} to explore the efficacy of bringing UCS into 3D as compared
across various display devices, in a standardized interface allowed by
the work stemming from RO \# 3. In this design, the factors are user
tasks (such as separation of clusters and ranking of manipulation
variable) across the treatment of display device (including 2D standard
monitor, 3D head-tracked monitor, and head-mounted display).
Quantitative measurements include participant speed and accuracy of
tasks, biometric readings, and subjective Likert surveys of
participants. A lineup-type model as outlined in
\textcite{hofmann_graphical_2012} may also be employed for assessing the
quality of display types.

\section{Workflow and
reproducibility}\label{workflow-and-reproducibility}

Figure \ref{fig:dataanalysisworkflow} depicts the general data analysis
workflow \autocite{wickham_r_2016}. Where data first must be imported
into a tool, the structure of the data must be tidied and ordered neatly
into the correct use format. After the data enters a repeating cycle,
where values may be transformed, visualized, and modeled with
communication going to the appropriate recipients. The research proposed
in this document aids exploratory data analysis as well as the
visualization aspect of this workflow. Mature analysis workflow is also
made reproducible with the use of programmatic scripts.





\begin{figure}

}

\caption{Data analysis workflow
\autocite{wickham_r_2016}. This research aids visualization in
exploratory data analysis and workflow.}\label{fig:dataanalysisworkflow}
\end{figure}

The programing language, \emph{R}, is used in the work described below
to import, tidy, and transform data. It can be used directly to
visualize 2D tours (RO \#1 \& 2) or be consumed into the game engine
\emph{Unity} to visualize 3D tours (RO \#3 \& 4). Doing analysis and
writeup in such programmatic ways allow work to be done reproducibly.
Where data, analysis, and code are stored in the same directory.
Reproducible work facilitates validation, maintains transparency and
minimizes the chance for human error. Reproduction of work is a key
feature to validate and defend the claims and methodology held within a
work. Directories of current and planned work are/will be hosted
publicly on GitHub, including this report. Accessing the source files
for this report is discussed in section \ref{sec:source}.

\section{Project overview}\label{ch:projectoverview}

Figure \ref{fig:ProjectOverview} depicts a schematic flow chart that the
research objectives will be executed in. The research stemming from RO
\#1, the application of 2D user-controlled steering (UCS), sets the
foundation for which the other objectives can be researched. RO \#3, the
application of 3D UCS, must precede RO \#4, as it explores the efficacy
of 3D UCS across display devices. RO \#2, the comparison of 2D UCS vs
alternatives, must come after RO \#1, but is of lower priority to RO \#3
\& 4, and so will be conducted last, in the event of a time crunch.

In this report, the related literature is discussed in chapter
\ref{ch:lit_review}. A brief overview of the research is given in
chapter \ref{ch:projectoverview}, followed by ongoing work and future
work in chapters \ref{ch:workinprogress} and \ref{ch:future_work}
respectively. A prospective timeline is listed in chapter
\ref{ch:timeline}. Notation for dynamic projections and VR data
visualization can be found in appendix \ref{ch:glossary} and an excerpt
of a paper to be submitted to the R Journal can be found in appendix
\ref{ch:spinifex_paper}.

\chapter{Literature review}\label{ch:lit_review}

The following chapter, discusses the current research in two primary
areas: dynamic linear projections (collectively known as tours) and
multivariate data visualization in stereoscopic 3D. After each section,
research gaps are highlighted.

\section{Dynamic linear projections of multivariate data
(tours)}\label{sec:tour}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview}

The introduction established that visualizing data-space is an important
aspect of exploratory data analysis and data analysis in general. Yet,
there is an inherent difficulty as the dimensionality of data increases.
In univariate data sets histograms or smoothed density curves are
employed to visualize data. In bivariate data, \(XY\) scatterplots and
contour plots (2D density) can be employed. In three dimensions, the two
most common techniques are 3D
scatterplot\footnote{Graphs depicting three dimensions are typically viewed on a 2D display, in print or with a standard monitor. These are 2D images of monocular 3D spaces, sometimes referred to as 2.5D data visualization, more on this in section \ref{sec:3d-terminology}.}
or 2D scatterplot with the 3rd variable as an aesthetic (such as color,
size, or height). These aesthetic cues convey some information but are
not a sufficient replacement for axes for use with continuous variables.

As dimensionality of the data, \(p\), increases the visualization of
data-space quickly becomes complex. It is common that visualizing
data-space is dropped in favor of graphing model-space (for example
residuals), parameter-space (in fewer dimensions), or worse yet: long
tables of statistics without visuals
\autocite{wickham_visualizing_2015}. To preserve the visualization of
data-space, a solution that scales with the dimensionality of data is
needed; this is where dimensionality reduction comes in. This work will
focus on a group of dynamic linear projection techniques collectively
known as \emph{tours}. The scope of the project lies within the dynamic
linear projections; a broader review of dimensionality reduction
techniques is discussed in the review paper by
\textcite{grinstein_high-dimensional_2002}. Tours are used for a couple
of salient features: the use of linear projections maintains
transparency back to the original variable space (which non-linear
projections lose) and the use of many projections shows more variation
than a single linear projection. Employing the breadth of tours extends
the dimensionality of visualizations, and with it, the intrinsic
understanding of the structure and distribution of data that is more
succinct or beyond the reach of summary statistics alone.

Let \(p\) be the dimensionality of the data, and \(d\) be the dimension
of the projection space. Tours perform linear dimensionality reduction,
orthogonally projecting \(p\)-space down to \(d(\leq p)\) dimensions.
Many such projections are interpolated, each making small rotations in
\(p\)-space. These frames are then viewed in order as an animation of
the lower dimensional embedding changing as the original variable space
is manipulated. Shadow puppets offer a useful analogy to aid in
conceptualizing tours. Imagine a fixed light source facing a wall. When
an object is introduced it projects a 2D shadow onto the wall. This is a
physical representation of a simple projection, that from \(p=3\) down
to \(d=2\). If the object rotates then the shadow correspondingly
changes. Observers watching only the shadow are functionally watching a
2D tour as the 3D object is manipulated. Some orientations explain more
information about the shape of the object than others, but watching an
animation of the shadow changing gives a more robust understanding than
looking at any one frame. More complex structures generally require more
time to comprehend the nature of the geometry. These features hold for
tours as well.

\emph{An extended tour notation is listed in the appendix section
\ref{sec:tour_notation}.}

\subsection{History}\label{history}

The first tour was introduced was the \emph{grand tour} in
\textcite{asimov_grand_1985} at the Stanford Linear Accelerator,
Stanford University. Asimov suggested three types of grand tours: torus,
at-random, and random-walk. The original application of tours was
performed on high energy physics on the PRIM-9 system.

Before choosing projection paths randomly, an exhaustive search of
\(p-\)space was suggested by \textcite{mcdonald_interactive_1982}, also
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator. This was later coined \emph{little
tour}.

\textcite{friedman_projection_1974} and later
\textcite{huber_projection_1985} recommended projection pursuit (also
referred to as PP). Projection pursuit optimizes an objective function
before it removes a single component/variable and then iterates in this
newly embedded subspace. Within each subspace, the projection seeks for
a local extremum via a hill climbing algorithm on an objective function.
This formed the basis for \emph{guided tours} suggested by
\textcite{hurley_analyzing_1990}.

The grand and little tours have no input from the user aside from the
starting basis. Guided tours allow for an index to be selected. The bulk
of tour development since has largely been around the dynamic display,
user interaction, geometric representation, and application.

\subsection{Path generation}\label{sec:path_generation}

A fundamental aspect of tours is the path of rotation. There are four
primary distinctions of tour path generation
\autocite{buja_computational_2005}: random choice, data-driven,
precomputed choice, and manual control.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Random choice, \emph{grand tour}, constrained random walks
  \(p\)-space. Paths are constrained for changes in direction small
  enough to maintain continuity and aid in user comprehension

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    torus-surface \autocite{asimov_grand_1985}
  \item
    at-random \autocite{asimov_grand_1985}
  \item
    random-walk \autocite{asimov_grand_1985}
  \item
    \emph{local tour} \autocite{wickham_tourr_2011}, a sort of grand
    tour on a leash, such that it goes to a nearby random projection
    before returning to the original position and iterating to a new
    nearby projection.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Data-driven, \emph{guided tour}, optimizing some objective
  function/index within the projection-space, called projection pursuit
  (PP) \autocite{hurley_analyzing_1990}, including the following
  indexes:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    holes \autocite{cook_projection_1993} - moves points away from the
    center.
  \item
    cmass \autocite{cook_projection_1993} - moves points toward the
    center.
  \item
    lda \autocite{lee_projection_2005} - linear discriminant analysis,
    seeks a projection where 2 or more classes are most separated.
  \item
    pda \autocite{lee_projection_2010} - penalized discriminant analysis
    for use in highly correlated variables when classification is
    needed.
  \item
    convex \autocite{laa_using_2019} - the ratio of the area of convex
    and alpha hulls.
  \item
    skinny \autocite{laa_using_2019} - the ratio of the perimeter
    distance to the area of the alpha hull.
  \item
    stringy \autocite{laa_using_2019} - based on the minimum spanning
    tree (MST), the diameter of the MST over the length of the MST.
  \item
    dcor2D \autocites{grimm_mbgraphic:_2017}{laa_using_2019} - distance
    correlation that finds linear and non-linear dependencies between
    variables.
  \item
    splines2D \autocites{grimm_mbgraphic:_2017}{laa_using_2019} -
    measure of non-linear dependence by fitting spline models.
  \item
    other user-defined objective indices can be apply to the framework
    provided in the \emph{tourr} package \textcite{wickham_tourr_2011}.
  \item
    Another data-drive tour is the \emph{dependence tour}, a combination
    of \(n\) independent 1D tours. A vector describes the axis each
    variable will be displayed on. for example \(c(1, 1, 2, 2)\) is a 4-
    to 2D tour with the first 2 variables on the first axis, and the
    remaining on the second.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \emph{correlation tour} \autocite{buja_data_1987}, a special case
      of the dependence tour, analogous to canonical correlation
      analysis.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Precomputed choice, \emph{planned tour}, in which the path has already
  been generated or defined.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{little tour} \autocite{mcdonald_interactive_1982}, where every
    permutation of variables is stepped through in order, analogous to
    brute-force or exhaustive search.
  \item
    a saved path of any other tour, typically an array of basis targets
    to interpolate between.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Manual control, \emph{manual tour}, a constrained rotation on selected
  manipulation variable and magnitude \autocite{cook_manual_1997}.
  Typically used to explore the local area after identifying an
  interesting feature, perhaps via guided tour.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Path evaluation}\label{path-evaluation}

Consider projection to 2D, then each projection is called a 2-frame
(each spanning a 2-plane). Mathematically, a Grassmannian is the set of
all possible unoriented 2-frames in \(p\)-space, \(\textbf{Gr}(2,~p)\).
\textcite{asimov_grand_1985} pointed out that the unique 2-frames of the
grand tour approaches \(\textbf{Gr}(2,~p)\) as time goes to infinity.
The \emph{density} of a tour is defined as the fraction of the
Grassmannian explored. Ideally, an exploring tour will be dense, but the
time taken to become dense vastly increases as variable space increases
dimensionality. \emph{Rapidity} is then defined as how quickly a tour
encompasses the Grassmannian. Due to the random selection of a grand
tour, it will end up visiting homomorphisms of previous 2-frames before
all unique values are visited, leading sub-optimal rapidity.

The little tour introduced in \textcite{mcdonald_interactive_1982}, on
the other hand, is necessarily both dense and rapid, performing
essentially an exhaustive search on the Grassmannian. However, this path
uninteresting and with long periods of similar projections strung
together. The Grassmannian is necessarily large and increases
exponentially at the rate of \(p\). Viewing of the whole Grassmannian is
time-consuming, and interesting projections are sparse, there was a
clear space for computers to narrow the search space.

Guided tours \autocite{hurley_analyzing_1990} optimize an objective
function generating path will be a relatively small subset of the
Grassmannian. As such, density and rapidity are poor measures, however,
interesting projections are quickly identified. Recently,
\textcite{laa_using_2019}, compared projection pursuit indices with the
metrics: \emph{smoothness, squintability, flexibility, rotation
invariance} and \emph{speed}.

\subsection{Geometric display by dimensionality}\label{sec:geom_display}

Up to this point, this document has discussed 2D scatterplots, which
offer a logical display for viewing embeddings of high-dimensional point
clouds. However, other geometrics offer perfectly valid projections as
well.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  1D geometrics (geoms)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    1D densities: such as histogram, average shifted histograms
    \autocite{scott_averaged_1985}, and kernel density
    \autocite{scott_incorporating_1995}.
  \item
    image (pixel): \autocite{wegman_pixel_2001}.
  \item
    time series: where multivariate values are independently lagged to
    view peak and trough alignment. Use case is discussed in
    \autocite{cook_manual_1997}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  2D geoms

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    2D density (available on GitHub at
    \url{https://github.com/nspyrison/tourr})
  \item
    \(XY\) scatterplot
  \end{itemize}
\item
  3D geoms

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Anaglyphs, sometimes called stereo, where red images are positioned
    for the left channel and cyan for the right when viewed with
    corresponding filter glasses give a perception of depth to the
    image.
  \item
    Depth, which gives depth cues via aesthetic mappings, most common
    size and/or color of data points.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(d\)-dimensional geoms

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Andrews curves \autocite{andrews_plots_1972}, smoothed variant of
    parallel coordinate plots, discussed below.
  \item
    Chernoff faces \autocite{chernoff_use_1973}, variables linked to the
    size of facial features for rapid cursory like-ness comparison of
    observations.
  \item
    Parallel coordinate plots \autocite{ocagne_coordonnees_1885}, where
    any number of variables are plotted in parallel with observations
    linked to their corresponding variable value by polylines.
  \item
    Scatterplot matrix \autocite{becker_brushing_1987}, showing a
    triangle matrix of bivariate scatterplots with 1D density on the
    diagonal.
  \item
    Radial glyphs, radial variants of parallel coordinates including
    radar, spider, and star glyphs \autocite{siegel_surgical_1972}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tour software}\label{tour-software}

Tours have not yet been widely adopted, this is likely due in part, to
the fact that print and static .pdf output does not accommodate dynamic
viewing. Conceptual abstraction and technically density have also
hampered user growth. Due to small adoption and rapid advancement of
technology support and maintenance of such implementations give them a
particularly short life span. Despite the small user base, there have
been a fair number of tour implementations, including:

\subsection{Research gaps}\label{research-gaps}

Dynamic projections of UCS had not incorporated recent animation
frameworks (\textbf{RO \#1}). This leaves the class of dynamic linear
projections without the most precise, fine-scale control of rotating
\(p\)-space. This should be implemented with an eye on extensibility and
maintainability.

A comparative study outlining the benefits of UCS vs alternatives is
also absent from the literature (\textbf{RO \#2}). The benefits of
dynamic linear projections withhold in theory, but a direct comparison
with popular alternatives should be made. Barriers to adoption should
also be addressed such as the dynamic display is not easy on print and
in .pdf documents.

\section{Multivariate data visualization in 3D}\label{sec:3d}

As this research pertains to numeric multivariate data, a wider overview
of 3D data visualization is discussed in chapter 2 of
\textcite{marriott_immersive_2018}. Terminology for 3D visuals is in the
glossary section \ref{sec:3d-terminology}.

\subsection{A rocky start}\label{a-rocky-start}

Scientific visualization has readily adopted mixed realities as a large
amount of the science exists in 3 spatial dimensions, lending itself
well to virtual immersion \autocite{marriott_immersive_2018}. Data
visualization, on the other hand, has been slow to utilize graphics
above 2.5D, (and haptic interaction) primarily due to the mixed results
of over-hyped of 3D visuals from the 1980s and '90s
\autocite{munzner_visualization_2014}. However, since then there have
been several promising studies suggesting that it is time for data
visualization to revisit and adopt 3D visuals for specific combinations
of visuals and depth cues.

\subsection{3D rotated projections vs 3 2D orthogonal
projections}\label{d-rotated-projections-vs-3-2d-orthogonal-projections}

3D shapes can be represented by 3 orthogonal 2D views, or rather 3
pairwise projections. When 3D representations are used with binocular
cues, they are found to have more accurate perception than 2D
counterparts \autocite{lee_effects_1986}.

Between 3D and split view 2D of 3-dimensional economics data
\textcite{wickens_implications_1994} asked participants integrative
questions, finding that participants were faster to answer when
questions involved three dimensions, while the performance was similar
when questions involved fewer dimensions.

Using 3D rotated projection gives more accurate perception (relative to
2D) of a ball suspended above complex box shapes, while combinations of
2D and 3D give the most precise orientation and positioning information
\autocite[depicted in figure
\ref{fig:tory06fig}]{tory_visualization_2006}.








\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./figures/tory06fig}

\caption{Screen capture from
\textcite{tory_visualization_2006}: ``fig. 1 (a) 2D, (b) 3D Rotated, (c)
3D Shadow, (d) Orientation Icon, and (e) ExoVis displays used in
Experiment 1 (position estimation). Participants estimated the height of
the ball relative to the block shape. In this example, the ball is at
height 1.5 diameters above the block shape.''}\label{fig:tory06fig}
\end{figure}

\textcite{sedlmair_empirical_2013}, depicted in figure
\ref{fig:sedlmair13fig}, tasked users with cluster separation across 2D
scatterplot, 2D scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs) and interactive 3D
scatterplots as viewed in monocular 3D from a standard monitor. They
conclude that interactive 3D scatterplots perform worse for class
separation. This result is surprising as the extra dimension
theoretically allows for the clustering structure to be seen and
explored more clearly.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparing 3D and 2D embeddings of multivariate
data}\label{comparing-3d-and-2d-embeddings-of-multivariate-data}

\textcite{nelson_xgobi_1998}, depicted in figure \ref{fig:nelson98fig},
had \(n=15\) participants perform brushing and identification tasks (of
clusters, structure, and data dimensionality) in 3D with head-tracked
binocular VR. 3D proved to have a substantial advantage for cluster
identification and some advantage in identifying the shape. Brushing did
take longer in VR, perhaps due to the lower familiarity of manipulating
3D spaces.







\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./figures/nelson98fig} 

}

\caption{Screen capture from \textcite{nelson_xgobi_1998}:
``figure 4: This is a picture of a 3-D room, running VRGobi. Data is
plotted in the center, with painting tools to the right and variable
spheres to the left. In the viewing box, the data can be seen to contain
three clusters, and one is being brushed.''}\label{fig:nelson98fig}
\end{figure}

Another study, \textcite{gracia_new_2016} performed dimensionality
reduction down to 2- and 3D scatterplots, both displayed in monocular 3D
on a standard monitor. Users were found to more accurately compare
distances between points and identify outliers on 3D scatterplots.
However, both tasks were performed slower with the use of the 3D
scatterplots and statistical significance was not reported.

\textcite{wagner_filho_immersive_2018}, depicted in figure
\ref{fig:wagner18fig}, performed an \(n=30\) empirical study of PCA
embedded projections, and perception error across 4 tasks and 3 display
types: 2D, 3D, and immersive. Overall task error was less in 3D and
immersive relative to 2D. According to the user Likert-scale survey, 2D
is slightly easier to navigate and slightly more comfortable, while, 3D
and immersive display are slightly easier to interact and moderately
easier to find information.

\subsection{Immersive analytics platform in
VR}\label{immersive-analytics-platform-in-vr}

Immersive analytics is an emerging field, where data visualization and
analysis is facilitated in an intuitive, immersive virtual reality
environment. An example of which is shown in
\textcite{cordeil_imaxes:_2017} introduces a collaborative space for
immersive data analysis. Where axes are displayed and intuitively
interacted with while responding to proximity to other variable axes and
popping into place changing the resulting geometric display. For
example, three variables can be placed as the \(x,~y,~z-\) axes for a 3D
scatterplot or stood up right next to each other for a parallel
coordinate plot. The subsequent work in
\textcite{cordeil_immersive_2019} builds from the previous reference and
refines it for the next iteration in interactive, scalable data
visualization in virtual spaces.




\begin{figure}

}

\caption{Screen capture of figure 15 from
\textcite{cordeil_imaxes:_2017}.}\label{fig:cordeil2017fig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Research gaps}\label{research-gaps-1}

When comparing between 3D and 2D orthogonal views studies, in general,
show that perception accuracy is better in 3D, though manipulation speed
is generally slower. The speed discrepancy is confounded by the
difference in users familiar with manipulating 2D vs 3D spaces
\autocites{lee_effects_1986}{wickens_implications_1994}{tory_visualization_2006}[counterexample][]{sedlmair_empirical_2013}.

Similar results have been shown in static, 3D projected spaces
\autocites{gracia_new_2016}{wagner_filho_immersive_2018} and in dynamic
2D embedded spaces depicted in immersive 3D
\autocite{nelson_xgobi_1998}. With Modern VR hardware advancement, so
too does the quality, resolution, and prevalence of VR advance, making
VR more easily accessible than ever. It's time to view dynamic 3D
projections with immersive spaces and quantify the corresponding
benefits (\textbf{RO \#3 \& 4}).

\chapter{Work in progress}\label{ch:workinprogress}

Extending the algorithm for UCS in low dimensions for generalized use in
graphics environments is fundamental to the extension of the UCS into 3D
space. This forms the foundation for future work addressed in the
remaining research objectives. This is a synthesis of the work that will
be submitted to the R Journal. A wider discussion of implementation as
an \emph{R} package and application to high energy physics data
\autocites{wang_visualizing_2018}{cook_dynamical_2018} is attached in
appendix \ref{ch:spinifex_paper} formatted as a paper.

\section{RO \#1) How can UCS be generalized to work within various
graphics environment for 2D
projections?}\label{ro-1-how-can-ucs-be-generalized-to-work-within-various-graphics-environment-for-2d-projections}

This chapter builds off of \emph{manual tours}
\autocite{cook_manual_1997} and extends the algorithm to generalized
graphics implementation. Manual tours allow users to rotate a selected
variable into and out of a 2D projection of high-dimensional space for
user-controlled steering (UCS). The primary use is to determine the
sensitivity of the structure to the contributions of a selected
manipulation variable. This is particularly powerful for exploring the
local structure once a feature of interest has been identified, by a
guided tour for example.

\section{Algorithm}\label{sec:algorithm}

Creating a manual tour animation requires these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Given a 2D projection basis, choose a variable to explore. This is
  called the ``manip'' variable.
\item
  Create a 3D manipulation space, where the manip variable has a full
  contribution.
\item
  Generate a rotation sequence which zeros coefficient and increases it
  to 1 before returning to the initial position.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Step 1 Choose variable of
interest}\label{step-1-choose-variable-of-interest}

Start with multivariate data in an \(n \times p\) numeric matrix, and an
orthonormal (orthogonal and each column normalized to have a norm of 1)
\(p \times d\) basis set is describing the projection from \(p-\) to
\(d-\)space. Select a manipulation (manip) variable. The coefficients of
this variable will be operated on.

\subsection{Step 2 Create the manip
space}\label{step-2-create-the-manip-space}

Use the Gram-Schmidt process to orthonormalize another dimension on the
basis with the full contribution on the manip variable. This brings the
basis into a 3D manip space. The new dimension giving the basis room to
rotate `out-of-plane', akin to being able to lift a piece of paper,
rather than being confined to the top of a table.

\subsection{Step 3 Generate rotation}\label{step-3-generate-rotation}

Define a set of values for two angles, the `in-plane' and
`out-of-plane', picture within an \(XY\) plane, and out of \(Z\)-axis.
For the corresponding value in each set, rotate (post multiply) the
manip space according to a rotation matrix.

\section{Display projection sequence}\label{display-projection-sequence}

To return to data-space, pre-multiply the rotated manip space by the
data. Plot the first two components as an \(XY\)-scatterplot viewed in
order. The first two coefficients of the rotated manip space are
typically drawn with lines returning to the origin within a unit circle
showing the direction of each variables contribution in the 2D
projection space.

\chapter{Future work}\label{ch:future_work}

\section{RO \#2) Does 2D UCS provide benefits over
alternatives?}\label{ro-2-does-2d-ucs-provide-benefits-over-alternatives}

High dimensional data and models are ubiquitous but viewing them in data
space is not trivial. This work quantifies various measurements of 2D
UCS applied in RO \#1, and commonly used alternatives. All comparison
groups are unsupervised (agnostic of clustering), static, single
embeddings in a lower dimension, and would include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}, is a linear
  transformation that orients linear combinations of the variables into
  basis components and orders them according to the amount of variation.
  The first principal component is the linear combination that explains
  the most variation with the second explaining the most of the
  remaining variation and is orthogonal to all previous components, and
  so on.
\item
  \textbf{Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)}, non-linear dimension
  reduction that compares pairwise distances between observations.
\item
  \textbf{t-distributed neighbor embeddings (tSNE)}, a nonlinear
  technique that iterates epochs of 1) constructing a probability
  distribution for selecting neighboring data and 2), minimizing
  Kullback-Leibler divergence (a measure of relative entropy).
\end{itemize}

Unfortunately, static linear projections necessarily cut variation in
the components not shown, while non-linear techniques lose transparency
back to the original variable space. Tours preserve this transparency to
variable-space and keep variation in tack. Providing user-controlled
steering of tours should allow for finer structural exploration than the
alternatives.

The methodology for this future work is a \textbf{case study} comparing
benchmark datasets across technique, UCS and leading alternatives. This
will be a sufficient comparison if there are enough quantifiable
measurements across the different techniques. However, if enough
measurements are not comparable across techniques an empirical study
analogous to the study suggested in RO \# 4 will be considered. Design
space includes data sets, techniques, and measures of comparison.

\section{RO \#3) How can UCS be extended to
3D?}\label{ro-3-how-can-ucs-be-extended-to-3d}

The literature has shown positive results for improved perception of 3D
graphics over 2D including static linear embeddings. The additional
dimension theoretically allows for the perception benefits in dynamic 3D
scatterplot projections and for improved perception of surfaces and
dynamic viewing of 3D projections. The research answering RO \#1 will be
extended to these uses.

The work done in \textcite{cordeil_imaxes:_2017} creates a collaborative
space for people to engage in immersive data analysis, a generalized
platform for data visualization in the Unity game engine. By integrating
dynamic linear projection in 3D with the above work offers a
consolidated user interface that can be used across various display
devices in RO \#4.

This is an \textbf{algorithm design}, first, the \emph{R} package
spinifex will be extended to 3D and function/surface projections will be
developed. After the projections are performed \emph{Unity} will be used
to render the embeddings in 3D VR and offer a compatible front end to be
used across display devices.

Manipulating 3D spaces may not be straight forward. In section
\{sec:algorithm\} the manipulation space was in 3D, where 2 angles
defined a point that was projected back to the 2D reference frame. The
now 4D manipulation space should only be nescary in internal
mathematics, where the 3 angles spanning it, could be controlled through
manipulation of a selected variable on the now 3D reference volume.
Navigating 3D space may be very intuitive or may require a slide ruler
for each axis may offer more control.





\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./figures/RO3MockUp2} 

}

\caption{A mockup of a 3D basis reference space and
scatterplot projection. Basis and projection axes should be marked from
the origin.}\label{fig:RO3MockUp}
\end{figure}

Viewing functions and surfaces have several difficulties in 3D the first
of which is occulation, the surfaces in the foreground blocks the view
behind it. Opacity, wire mesh, and projection sectioning are ways to
address this issue. A second issue is that it may be disorienting or
nauseating to watch surfaces folding into each other.

If UCS happens in real time the angular speed of the tour should be
regulated for continuity of observation and to mitigate potentially
nauseating movement.

The design space includes the path generators (outlined in section
\ref{sec:path_generation}), geometric display (section
\ref{sec:geom_display}), layout in virtual space, dynamic interactions.
Tour paths are conceptually straight-forward mapping between values and
3D rendering. Each geometric display will need unique recreation, though
3D scatterplot, parallel coordinate plot and scatterplot matrices
(SPLOM) are currently supported in the respective packages in both
languages. Dynamic surface and function visualization will also be
explored in 3D.

\section{RO \#4) Does UCS in 3D displays provide perception benefits
over 2D displays?}\label{UCS_3dvs2d}

The bulk of previous tours have existed whole in 2D, with the exceptions
of \textcite{nelson_xgobi_1998} and \textcite{arms_benefits_1999} who
performed an \(n=15\) experimental study comparing tasks performed
across 2D and 3D tour displays. The XGobi interface was used on a
standard 2D monitor while VRGobi (on the C2 setup) was used with
head-tracked binocular VR. The 3 accuracy tasks: clustering, intrinsic
data dimensionality, and radial sparseness were recorded along with the
speed of brushing data. Accuracy was the same for the dimensionality
task, while 3D display outperformed 2D on clustering, and even more so
on the radial sparsity. However, the time taken to brush a cluster was
less than half the time in 2D displays as compared with 3D.

\textcite{wagner_filho_immersive_2018} performed a user study on the
perception of linear projections between 2D, 3D, and immersive 3D. The
\(n=30\) user study created 3D embeddings of multidimensional data via
principal component analysis (PCA, described in RO \#2, above). Users
performed 3 tasks across 2 data sets and 3 displays; 2D, 3D, and
immersive 3D. Data sets were chosen to have vastly different amounts of
information contained in the 3rd principal component. They find that the
introduction of a 3rd dimension in visualization improves task
performance (perception error, task error, and completion time)
regardless of immersion for only the dataset containing promising
information gain in 3D. Independent of the dataset, immersive 3D display
led to a larger subjective perception of accuracy and engagement.

The results of \textcite{wagner_filho_immersive_2018},
\textcite{nelson_xgobi_1998} and, \textcite{arms_benefits_1999} cast
positive light on 3D spaces improving the perception of embeddings of
high-dimensional data. Others have found the same for data already in
three dimensions. After tours have been extended in 3D spaces (RO \#3),
the effects of viewing dynamic projections should be quantified across
the display type.

I plan to test the efficacy of doing so with the following controlled
\textbf{usability study}, where every participant will complete every
task on every display device. Task order and display device will be
randomly assigned to minimize learning bias. Correctness and speed of
tasks will be recorded alongside demographic data and subjective 5-point
Likert scale survey. A lineup-type model as outlined in
\textcite{hofmann_graphical_2012} may be employed to quantify the
``best'' display device.

The factors of the study are user tasks: the perception of cluster
structure, surface structure, and ranking of manipulation variables. All
factors will be tested across the treatment of at least three display
devices: standard 2D monitor, stereoscopic 3D monitor (on a zSpace 200),
and head-mounted VR goggles (HTC VIVE). The user interface will be
standardized across display devices. The data explored will be of high
energy physics experiments already being discussed in publication
\autocites{wang_visualizing_2018}{cook_dynamical_2018} and looked at in
2D UCS in appendix \ref{ch:spinifex_paper}.

\chapter{Using animation to explore the sensitivity of structure in a
low-dimensional projection of high-dimensional data with user controlled
steering}\label{ch:spinifex_paper}

\emph{The content contained in this appendix document is work done in
the last year of my research and currently formatted as a paper to be
submitted to the R Journal.}

\section{Abstract}\label{abstract-1}

The tour algorithm and its various versions provide a systematic
approach to viewing low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional
data. It is particularly useful for understanding multivariate data, and
useful in association with techniques for dimension reduction,
supervised, and unsupervised classification. The \emph{R} package
\emph{tourr} provides many methods for conducting tours on multivariate
data. This paper discusses an extension package that adds support for
the manual tour, called \emph{spinifex}. It is particularly usefully for
exploring the sensitivity of structure discovered in a projection by a
guided tour, to the contribution of a variable. \emph{Spinifex} utilizes
the animation packages \emph{plotly} and \emph{gganimation} to allow
users to rotate the selected variable into and out of a chosen
projection.

Keywords: grand tour, projection pursuit, manual tour, high dimensional
data, multivariate data, data visualization, statistical graphics, data
science, data mining.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

A tour is a multivariate data analysis technique in which is a sequence
of linear (orthogonal) projections into a lower subspace in which
\(p-\)space is rotated across time. Each frame of the sequence
corresponds to a small change in the projection for a smooth transition
to persevere the object continuity.

Multivariate data analysis can be broken into 2 groups: linear and
non-linear transformations. Like PCA and LDA, tours use linear dimension
reduction that maintains transparency back to the original variable
space. PCA and LDA are typically represented with single static
projection as a 2- or 3D scatterplot, inherently losing the variation
held with the high components, whereas tours keep the information in
tack by showing the other components across time. Non-linear
transformations such as tSNE (t-distributed stochastic nearest neighbor
embeddings), MDS (multi-dimension scaling), and LLE (local linear
embedding) distort the parameter-space which lacks transparency back to
the original parameter-space. They show more extreme separation in
embeddings, but the variable opacity can be a non-starter for many uses.

There are many ways that a tour path can be generated, we will focus on
one, the manual tour. The manual tour was described in
\textcite{cook_manual_1997} and allows a user to rotate a variable into
and out of a 2D projection of high-dimensional space. This will be
called user-controlled steering (UCS). The primary purpose is to
determine the sensitivity of structure visible in a projection to the
contributions of a variable. Making them particularly useful for
exploring the local structure once a feature of interest has been
identified, for example, by a guided tour \autocite{cook_grand_1995}.
The algorithm for a manual tour allows rotations in horizontal,
vertical, oblique, angular and radial directions. Rotation in a radial
direction would pull a variable into and out of the projection, which
allows for examining the sensitivity of structure in the projection to
the contribution of this variable. This type of manual rotation is the
focus of this paper.

A manual tour relies on user input and thus has been difficult to
implement dynamic control in R. Ideally, the mouse movements of the user
are captured, and passed to the computations, driving the rotation
interactively. However, this type of interactivity is not simple in R.
This has been the reason that the algorithm was not incorporated into
the \emph{tourr} package. Spinifex utilizes two new animation packages,
\emph{plotly} \autocite{sievert_plotly_2018} and \emph{gganimate}
\autocite{pedersen_gganimate:_2019}, to display manual tours or other
saved tours. From a given projection, the user can choose which variable
to control, and the animation sequence is generated to remove the
variable from the projection, and then extend its contribution to be the
sole variable in one direction. This allows the viewer to assess the
change in structure induced in the projection by the variable's
contribution.

The paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:algorithm} explains
the algorithm using a toy dataset. Section \ref{sec:application}
illustrates how this can be used for sensitivity analysis. The last
section, \ref{sec:discussion_paper} summarizes the work and discusses
future research.

\section{Algorithm}\label{sec:algorithm_paper}

Creating a manual tour animation requires these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Provided with a 2D projection, choose a variable to explore. This is
  called the ``manip'' variable.
\item
  Create a 3D manipulation space, where the manip variable has full
  contribution.
\item
  Generate a rotation sequence which zero's the norm of the coefficient
  and increases it to 1.
\end{enumerate}

These steps are described in more detail below.

\subsection{Notation}\label{notation}

This section describes the notation used in the algorithm description.
The data to be displayed is an \(n \times p\) numeric matrix.

\begin{align*}
  \textbf{X}_{[n,~p]} ~=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    X_{1,~1} & \dots  & X_{1,~p} \\
    X_{2,~1} & \dots  & X_{2,~p} \\
    \vdots   & \ddots & \vdots   \\
    X_{n,~1} & \dots  & X_{n,~p}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

An orthonormal \(d\)-dimensional basis set is describing the projection
from \(p-\) to \(d-\) space

\begin{align*}
  \textbf{B}_{[p,~d]} ~=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    B_{1,~1} & \dots  & B_{1,~d} \\
    B_{2,~1} & \dots  & B_{2,~d} \\
    \vdots   & \ddots & \vdots   \\
    B_{p,~1} & \dots  & B_{p,~d}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

The algorithm is primarily operating on the projection basis and
utilizes the data only when making a display.

\subsection{Toy data set}\label{toy-data-set}

The flea data from the R package \emph{tourr}
\autocite{wickham_tourr_2011}, is used to illustrate the algorithm. The
data, originally from \textcite{lubischew_use_1962}, contains 74
observations across 6 variables, which physical measurements of the
insects. Each observation belonging to one of three species.

A guided tour on the flea data is conducted by optimizing on the
\texttt{holes} index \autocite{cook_interactive_2007}. In a guided tour
the projection sequence is selected by optimizing an index of interest.
The holes index is maximized by when the projected data has a lack of
observations in the center. Figure \ref{fig:step0}, shows an optimal
projection of this data. The left plot displays the projection basis,
while the right plot shows the projected data. The display of the basis
has a unit circle with lines showing the horizontal and vertical
contributions of each variable in the projection. Here is primarily
tars1 and aede2 contrasting the other four variables. In the projected
data there are three clusters, which have been colored, although not
used in the optimization. The question that will be explored in the
explanation of the algorithm is how important is aede2 to the separation
of the clusters.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{confirmation_report_ns_files/figure-latex/step0-paper-1} 

}

\caption{Basis reference frame (left) and projected data (right) of standardized flea data. Basis identified by holes-index guided tour. The variables `aede2` and `tars1` contribute mostly in the x direction, whereas the other variables contribute mostly in the y direction. We'll select `aede2` as our manipulation variable to see how the structure of the projection changes as we rotate `aede2` into and out of the projection.}\label{fig:step0-paper}
\end{figure}

The left frame of figure \ref{fig:step0-paper} shows the reference frame
for the basis. It describes the X and Y contributions of the basis as it
projects from the 6 variable dimensions down to 2. Call
\texttt{view\_basis()} on a basis to produce a similar image as a
\texttt{ggplot2} object. The right side shows how the data looks
projected through this basis. You can project a single basis at any time
through the matrix multiplication
\(\textbf{X}_{[n,~p]} ~*~ \textbf{B}_{[p,~d]} ~=~ \textbf{P}_{d[n,~d]}\)
to such effect.

\subsection{Step 1 Choose variable of
interest}\label{step-1-choose-variable-of-interest-1}

Select a manipulation variable, \(k\). Initialize a zero vector \(e\)
and set the \(k\)-th element set to 1.

\begin{align*}
\textbf{e}_{[p,~1]} ~=~
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\
    0 \\
    \vdots \\
    1 \\
    \vdots \\
    0
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

In figure \ref{fig:step0-paper}, above, notice that the variables
\texttt{tars1} and \texttt{aede2} are almost orthogonal to the other 4
variables and control almost all of the variation in the x-axis of the
projection. \texttt{Aede2} has a larger contribution on this basis, so
we'll select it as the manip variable.

\subsection{Step 2 Create the manip
space}\label{step-2-create-the-manip-space-1}

Use the Gram-Schmidt process to orthonormalize the concatenation of the
basis and \(e\) yielding the manipulation space.

\begin{align*}
  \textbf{M}_{[p,~d+1]}
  &= Orthonormalize_{GS}( \textbf{B}_{[p,~d]}|\textbf{e}_{[p,~1]} ) \\
  &= Orthonormalize_{GS}
  \left(
    \begin{bmatrix}
      B_{1,~1} & \dots  & B_{1,~d} \\
      B_{2,~1} & \dots  & B_{2,~d} \\
      \vdots   & \ddots & \vdots   \\
      B_{k,~1} & \dots  & B_{k,~d} \\
      \vdots   & \ddots & \vdots   \\
      B_{p,~1} & \dots  & B_{p,~d}
    \end{bmatrix}
  ~|~
    \begin{bmatrix}
      0 \\
      0 \\
      \vdots \\
      1 \\
      \vdots \\
      0
    \end{bmatrix}
  \right)
\end{align*}

In R it looks like the below chunk. \texttt{tourr::orthonormalise()}
uses the Gram Schmidt process (rather than Householder reflection) to
orthonormalize.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{  e            <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{rep}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{len =} \KeywordTok{nrow}\NormalTok{(basis))}
\NormalTok{  e[manip_var] <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1}
\NormalTok{  manip_space  <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{tourr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{orthonormalise}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{cbind}\NormalTok{(basis, e))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Adding an extra dimension to our basis plane allows for the manipulation
of the specified variable. Orthonormalizing rescales the new vector
while leaving the first \(d\) variables identical to the basis. An
illustration of such can be seen below in figure \ref{fig:step2-paper}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{confirmation_report_ns_files/figure-latex/step2-paper-1} 

}

\caption{Manipulation space for controlling the contribution of aede2 of standardized flea data. Basis was identified by holes-index guided tour. The out of plane axis, in red, shows how the manipulation variable can be rotated, while other dimensions stay embedded within the basis plane.}\label{fig:step2-paper}
\end{figure}

Imagine being able to grab hold of the red axis and rotate it changing
the projection onto the basis plane. This is what happens in a manual
tour. For a radial tour, fix \(\phi\), the angle within the blue plain,
and vary the \(\theta\), the angle between the red and blue lines. The
user controlling these angles changes the values of the coefficient the
manip variable and performs a constrained rotation on the remaining
variables.

\subsection{Step 3 Generate rotation}\label{step-3-generate-rotation-1}

Define a set of values for \(\phi_i\), the angle of out of the plane
rotation, orthogonal to the projection plane. This corresponds to the
angle between the red manipulation axis and the blue plane in figure
\ref{fig:step2-paper}.

\textbf{For } \(i\) \textbf{in 1 to n\_slides:}

For each \(\phi_i\), post multiply the manipulation space by a rotation
matrix, producing, \textbf{RM}, the rotated manip space.

\begin{align*}
  \textbf{RM}_{[p,~d+1,~i]}
  &= \textbf{M}_{[p,~d+1]} ~*~ \textbf{R}_{[d+1,~d+1]}
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\text{For the $d=2$ case:} \\
  &= \begin{bmatrix}
    M_{1,~1} & \dots & M_{1,~d} & M_{1,~d+1} \\
    M_{2,~1} & \dots & M_{2,~d} & M_{2,~d+1} \\
    \vdots   & \ddots& \vdots   \\
    M_{p,~1} & \dots & M_{p,~d} & M_{p,~d+1}
  \end{bmatrix}_{[p,~d+1]}
    ~*~
  \begin{bmatrix}
    c_\theta^2 c_\phi s_\theta^2 &
    -c_\theta s_\theta (1 - c_\phi) &
    -c_\theta s_\phi \\
    -c_\theta s_\theta (1 - c_\phi) &
    s_\theta^2 c_\phi + c_\theta^2 &
    -s_\theta s_\phi \\
    c_\theta s_\phi &
    s_\theta s_\phi &
    c_\phi
  \end{bmatrix}_{[3,~3]}
\end{align*}

Where:

\begin{description}
  \item[$\theta$] is the angle that lies on the projection plane, the *XY*-scatterplot
  \item[$\phi$] is the angle orthogonal to the projection plane, in the *Z* direction relative to the *XY*-scatterplot
  \item[$c_\theta$] is the cosine of $\theta$
  \item[$c_\phi$]   is the cosine of $\phi$
  \item[$s_\theta$] is the sine of   $\theta$
  \item[$s_\phi$]   is the sine of   $\phi$
\end{description}

In application: compile the sequence of \(\phi_i\) and create an array
(or long table) for each rotated manipulation space. \(\phi\) is the
angle relative to the \(\phi_1\), we find the transformation \(\phi_i\)
- \(\phi_1\) useful to think about \(\phi\) relative to the basis plane.
If the manip variable doesn't move as expected this is the first place
to check.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In figure \ref{fig:step3-paper} we illustrate the sequence with 15
projected bases and highlight the manip variable on top, while showing
the corresponding projected data points on the bottom. A dynamic version
of this tour can be viewed online at
\url{https://nspyrison.netlify.com/thesis/flea_manualtour_mvar5/}, will
take a moment to load. This format of this figure and linking to a
dynamic version will be used again in section \ref{sec:application}.

\end{figure}

\section{Display projection
sequence}\label{display-projection-sequence-1}

To get back to data-space pre-multiply the rotated manip space by the
data for the projection in data-space.

\begin{align}
  \textbf{P}_{[n,~d+1]}
    &= \textbf{X}_{[n,~p]} ~*~ \textbf{RM}_{[p,~d+1]} \\
    &=
      \begin{bmatrix}
          X_{1,~1} & \dots & X_{1,~p} \\
          X_{2,~1} & \dots & X_{2,~p} \\
          \vdots   & \vdots & \vdots  \\
          X_{n,~1} & \dots & X_{n,~p}
      \end{bmatrix}_{[n,~p]}
      ~*~
      \begin{bmatrix}
        RM_{1,~1} & RM_{1,~2} & RM_{1,~3} \\
        RM_{2,~1} & RM_{2,~2} & RM_{2,~3} \\
        \vdots     & \vdots     & \vdots     \\
        RM_{p,~1} & RM_{p,~2} & RM_{p,~3}
      \end{bmatrix}_{[p,~d+1]}
\end{align}

Plot the first 2 variables from each projection in sequence for an XY
scatterplot. The remaining variable is sometimes linked to a data point
aesthetic to produce depth cues used in conjunction with the XY
scatterplot.

\emph{tourr} utilizes R's base graphics for the display of tours. Use
\texttt{render\_plotly()} to display as an dynamic \texttt{plotly}
\textcite{sievert_plotly_2018} object or \texttt{render\_gganimate()}
for a \texttt{gganimate} \textcite{pedersen_gganimate:_2019} graphic.
Both of which build off of \texttt{ggplot2} plotting in interal
functions.

Interaction with graphics in R is limited. Traditionally, all commands
are passed to the R via calls to the console, conflicting with user
engagement. Some recent packages have made advancement into this
direction such as with the use of the R package \texttt{shiny}, which
custom-made applications can be hosted either locally or remotely and
interact with the R console, allowing for developers to code dynamic
content interaction. To a lesser extent, \texttt{plotly} offers static
interactions with the contained object, such as tooltips, brushing, and
linking without communicating back to the R console.

\subsection{Storage and sharing}\label{storage-and-sharing}

Storing each data point for every frame with the overhead dynamic
graphics is very inefficient. In the same way that we gain efficiency by
performing math on the bases, that is the same approach suggested for
storage and sharing tours. Consider a radial manual tour, we can store
the salient features in 3 bases, where \(\phi\) is at its starting,
minimum, and maximum values. The frames in between can be interpolated
by supplying angular speed. By using the \texttt{tourr::save\_history()}
we can do just that. Save such tour path history and a single set of
data offers performant storage and transfer.

\section{Application}\label{sec:application}

In a recent paper, \textcite{wang_visualizing_2018}, the authors
aggregate and visualize the sensitivity of hadronic experiments. The
authors introduce a new tool, PDFSense, to aid in the visualization of
parton distribution functions (PDF). The parameter-space of these
experiments lies in 56 dimensions, \(\delta \in \mathbb{R}^{56}\), and
are presented in this work in 3D subspaces of the 10 first principal
components and non-linear embeddings.

The work in \textcite{cook_dynamical_2018} applies manual tours to
discern the finer structure of this sensitivity. Table 1 of Cook et. al.
summaries the key findings of PDFSense \& TFEP (TensorFlow embedded
projection) and those from manual tours. The authors selected the 6
first principal components, containing 48\% of the variation held within
the full data when centered, but not sphered. This data contained 3
clusters: jet, DIS, and VBP. Below pick up from the projections used in
their figures 7 and 8 (jet and DIS clusters respectively) and apply
manual tours to explore the local structure with finer precision.

\subsection{Jet cluster}\label{jet-cluster}

The jet cluster is of particular interest as it contains the largest
data sets and is found to be important in
\textcite{wang_visualizing_2018}. The jet cluster resides in a smaller
dimensionality than the full set of experiments with 4 principal
components explaining 95\% of its variation
\autocite{cook_dynamical_2018}. We subset the data down to ATLAS7old and
ATLAS7new to narrow in on 2 groups with a reasonable number of
observations and occupy different parts of the subspace. Below, we
perform radial manual tours on various principal components within this
scope. In PC3 and PC4 are manipulated in figure \ref{fig:JetClusterGood}
and figure \ref{fig:JetClusterBad} respectively. Manipulating PC3, where
varying the angle of rotation brings interesting features into and out
of the center mass of the data, is interesting than the manipulation of
PC4, where features are mostly independent of the manip var.

contribution from PC3 to the projection hides the outliers and indeed
all observations with ATLAS7new are contained within ATLAS7old (orange).

points occupy the same projection space, regardless of the contribution
of PC4. A dynamic version can be viewed at

and

\subsection{DIS cluster}\label{dis-cluster}

We perform a manual tour on this data, manipulating PC6 as depicted in
figure \ref{fig:DISclusterGood}. Looking at several frames we see that
DIS HERA data lies mostly on a plane. When PC6 has full contributions,
we see the dimuon SIDIS in purple is almost orthogonal to the DIS HERA
(green). Yet the contribution of PC6 has zeroed the dimuon SIDIS data
occupy the same space as the DIS HERA data. A dynamic version of this
manual tour can be found at:
\url{https://nspyrison.netlify.com/thesis/discluster_manualtour_pc6/}.
The page takes a bit to load, as the animation is several megabytes.

\caption{DIS cluster, a radial manual tour of PC6.
colored by experiment type: `DIS HERA1+2' in green, `dimuon SIDIS' in
purple, and `charm SIDIS' in orange. When the contribution PC 6 is large
we see that dimuon SIDIS (purple) data are nearly orthogonal to DIS HERA
(green) data. As the data is rotated, we can also see that DIS HERA
(green) practically lies on a plane in this 6-d subspace. When the
contribution of PC6 is near zero, dimonSIDIS (purple) occupies the same
space as the DIS HERA data. A dynamic version can be viewed at
\url{https://nspyrison.netlify.com/thesis/discluster_manualtour_pc6/}.}\label{fig:DISclusterGood}
\end{figure}

This is a different story than if we had selected a different variable
to manipulate. In figure \ref{fig:DISclusterBad} we manipulate PC2.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion_paper}

This work has described an algorithm and package for exploring
conducting a manual tour, from a 2D projection, to explore the
sensitivity of structure to the contributions of a variable.

Future work on the algorithm and package would include developing it to
work with arbitrary projection dimension, enabling the method to operate
on \(p-\) dimensional geoms, such as parallel coordinates, and
implementing the unconstrained manual control, called oblique in
\textcite{cook_manual_1997}.

The Givens rotations and Householder reflections as outlined in
\textcite{buja_computational_2005} may provide a way to conduct higher
dimensional manual control. In a Givens rotation, the \(x\) and \(y\)
components (for example \(\theta~= 0,~pi/2\)) of the in-plane rotation
are calculated separately and would be applied sequentially to produce
the radial rotation. Householder reflections define reflection axes to
project points on to the axes and generate rotations.

The \emph{tourr} package provides several \(d\)-dimensional graphic
displays including Andrews curves, Chernoff faces, parallel coordinate
plots, scatterplot matrix, and radial glyphs. Having manual controls
available for these types of displays would require a
dimensionally-generalized rotation matrix.

The development of a graphical user interface, e.g. \emph{shiny} app,
would make the \emph{spinifex} package more flexible. The user could
easily switch between variables to control, adjust the step size to make
smoother rotation sequences, or save any state to continue to continue
to explore the contributions of other variables. The \texttt{animation}
package \textcite{xie_animation:_2018} could be implemented for another
graphic framework. However, \texttt{animation} must stem from base
graphing, unlike the \texttt{plotly} and \texttt{gganimate} which are
using \texttt{ggplot2} graphics.
