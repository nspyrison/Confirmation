# spinifex: manual control of dynamic linear projections of high-dimensional data

<!-- # Using animation to explore the sensitivity of structure in a low-dimensional projection of high-dimensional data with user controlled steering {#ch:spinifex} 

*The content contained in this appendix document is work done in the last year of my research and formatted as a paper to be submitted to the R Journal.* -->

## Abstract

<!-- SPINIFEX -->
The class of dynamic linear projections that are collectively known as 'tours' provide a unique means of visualizing numeric multivariate data. Tours are particularly useful for understanding the structure held within multivariate data, and in association with techniques for dimension reduction, supervised, and unsupervised classification. The *R* package *tourr* offers a variety of path generators and geometric displays for conducting tours. This paper discusses an extension package, *spinifex*, that adds support for the path generation of manual tours and extends the display of tours to use with the contemporary animation packages, *plotly* and *gganimate*. Manual tours are used to explore the sensitivity of structure as the contributions of a manipulation variable are changed. This particularly useful after identifying a feature of interest.

Keywords: manual tour, guided tour, grand tour, projection pursuit, high dimensional data, multivariate data, data visualization, statistical graphics, data science.


## Introduction

<!-- TOURS -->
A tour is a multivariate data analysis technique in which a sequence of linear (orthogonal) projections are viewed as an animation while the orientation of the projection basis is rotated across time. Each frame of the sequence corresponds to a small change in the projection for a smooth transition that perseveres continuity.

<!-- MANUAL TOUR -->
While there are numerous methods that generate tour paths, this research focuses on the manual tour. The manual tour was described in @cook_manual_1997 and allows a user to control the projection coefficients of a select variable has in a 2D projection. The manipulation of these coefficients allows the analyst to explore how sensitive the projections structure is to these changes. This makes manual tours particularly useful once a feature of interest has been identified, for example, with the use of a guided tour [@cook_grand_1995]. The path of a guided tour is selected via projection pursuit, the optimization of an index function on the projection via a hill climbing algorithm. This allows guided tours to identify interesting projection features rapidly given the relatively large parameter-space. Once the given projection has been provided, it is time to define the path of rotation.

<!-- MANUAL TOUR PATHS -->
Ideally, the path would be intuitively user-generated from physical movement, be it through mouse or motion capture. Unfortunately, this type of dynamic control has proven difficult to capture for in R. Because of this, manual tours were not implemented in *tourr*. This research allows for the consumption, but not the generation, of such dynamic input. After the capture of an oblique user motion, the rotation needs to be applied to step 3 (rotation sequence) of the algorithm discussed below. In the section below we stick with a radial rotation where, $\theta$, the angle of in-projection-plane rotation is held constant.

<!-- DISPLAY -->
Spinifex utilizes two new animation packages, *plotly* [@sievert_plotly_2018] and *gganimate* [@pedersen_gganimate:_2019], to display tours, manual or other saved tours. From a given projection, the user can choose which variable to control, and the animation sequence is generated to remove the variable from the projection, and then extend its contribution to be the sole variable in one direction. This allows the viewer to assess the change in structure induced in the projection by the variable's contribution.

<!-- PAPER STRUCTURE -->
The paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:algorithm} explains the algorithm using a toy dataset. Section \ref{sec:display} discussed the display of the animation after the path has been generated. Section \ref{sec:application} illustrates how this can be used for sensitivity analysis applied to contemporary high energy physics. The last section, \ref{sec:discussion} summarizes the work and discusses future research.


<!-- Algorithm outline -->
## Algorithm {#sec:algorithm}

The section below describes the algorithm for performing a 2D radial manual tour:

1. Provided with a 2D projection, choose a variable to explore. This is called the "manip" variable.
2. Create a 3D manipulation space, where the manip variable has the full contribution.
3. Generate a rotation sequence which increases the norm of the coefficient to 1 and zeros it.

The steps are described in more detail below.

### Notation

This section describes the notation used in the algorithm for a 2D radial manual tour.

<!-- remember mixing latex and rmarkdown bullets isn't trivial. -->
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\textbf{X}$, the data, an $n \times p$ numeric matrix to be embedded in two dimensions.
  \item $\textbf{B} = (B_1,~ B_2)$, any of orthonormal projection basis set, $p \times 2$ matrix, describing the projection from $p$ to two dimensions
  \item $\textbf{e}$, a zero column vector of length $p$ with the $k-$th element set to one, where $k$ is the number of the variable to manipulate.
  \item $\theta$, the angle of in-projection-plane rotation, for example, on the reference axes. 
  \item $\phi$, the angle of out-of-projection-plane rotation, coming into the manipulation space.
\end{itemize}

The algorithm primarily operates on the projection basis and utilizes the data only when making a display. The projection space can be viewed at any point in the process by pre-multiplying the data and plotting the first 2 variables.


### Toy data set

<!-- describe data. -->
The flea data, originally from @lubischew_use_1962, available in the R package *tourr* [@wickham_tourr_2011] is used to illustrate the algorithm. The data contains 74 observations across 6 variables, physical measurements of the flea beetles. Each observation belonging to one of three species.

<!-- Projection basis -->
The data is defined. A basis set (ideally that views an interesting feature) should be provided to explore the sensitivity of the variables to the structure. To identify a projection containing an interesting feature, apply
a guided tour[@cook_interactive_2007] on the flea data. In a guided tour the projection sequence is selected by optimizing an index via hill-climbing. In this case, the holes index is selected. The holes index is maximized by when the projected observations are furthest from the center. Figure \@ref(fig:step0) shows a locally optimized projection for this data. The left plot displays the reference axes of the projection basis, a visual indication of the magnitude and direction each variable contributed to the projections. The right plot shows the projection of the data through the basis set described by the reference axes (left). Data points are colored and given point characters according to the species of the flea (the guided tour was unsupervised with this information).

(ref:step0-cap) Basis reference axes (left) and projected data (right) of standardized flea data. Data points color and shape are mapped to beetle species. Basis identified by a holes-index guided tour. The variables `aede2` and `tars1` contribute mostly orthogonal to the other variables. We'll select `aede2` as our manipulation variable to see how the structure of the projection changes as we rotate `aede2` into and out of the projection.

```{r step0, echo=F, results='hide', out.width='95%', fig.cap = "(ref:step0-cap)"}
## Flea holes tour
f_dat  <- tourr::rescale(flea[,1:6])
f_cat  <- factor(flea$species)
f_path <- save_history(f_dat, guided_tour(holes()))
f_bas  <- matrix(f_path[,, max(dim(f_path)[3])], ncol=2)
f_mvar <- 5
f_msp  <- create_manip_space(basis = f_bas, manip_var = f_mvar)
f_proj <- data.frame(tourr::rescale(f_dat %*% f_msp[, 1:2]))

# step0, output
# Adjust centering to make axes and data side by side
view_basis(f_bas, labels = colnames(f_dat)) +
  geom_point(data = f_proj,
             mapping = aes(x = X1 + .75, y = X2 - .5, color = f_cat),
             pch = as.integer(f_cat) + 15) +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill = NA))
```

Call `view_basis()` on a basis to produce a `ggplot2` graphic similar to \@ref(fig:step0). Projection space is always available for display via the matrix multiplication $\textbf{X}_{[n,~p]} ~*~ \textbf{B}_{[p,~d]} ~=~ \textbf{P}_{[n,~d]}$.



### Step 1) Choose variable of interest

<!-- select a manip var-->
In figure \@ref(fig:step0), above, the contributions of the variables `tars1` and `aede2` are mostly orthogonal to the contributions of the other four variables. These two variables explain the variation of the data between the purple and green species. We select `aede2` as the manip var, the variable to be manipulated as it typically has a larger contribution after the optimizing the holes index. The question that will be explored in the explanation of the algorithm is how important the variable `aede2` is to the separation of the clusters.


### Step 2) Create the manip space

<!-- Zero Vect, manip sp -->
Initialize a zero vector $e$ of $p$ elements. Because `aede2` is the fifth variable in the data, set the $k=5$-th element to one giving the manip var a full contribution in this dimension. Use the Gram-Schmidt process to orthonormalize the zero vector onto the basis yielding the 3D manipulation space, **M**.

\begin{align*}
  \textbf{e} &\leftarrow Orthonormalize_{GS}(\textbf{e}) w.r.t. Basis \\
  &= \textbf{e} - \langle \textbf{e},\textbf{B}_1 \rangle \textbf{B}_1 - \langle \textbf{e}, \textbf{B}_2 \rangle \textbf{B}_2 \\
  \\
  \textbf{M}_{[p,~3]} &= (\textbf{B}_1,\textbf{B}_2,\textbf{e})
\end{align*}

<!-- What the manip space facilitates -->
Adding this extra dimension to our basis plane allows for the coefficients of the specified variable to be changed. For example, the ability to lift a piece of paper, rather than being constrained to the motion on a table top. Orthonormalizing rescales the new depth vector while the projection down to 2D is the original basis, that is the first $d$ vectors remain constant. Imagine the reference axes (and projection plane) laying flat on a table, while a new dimension exists with axes projecting back onto the reference axes. An illustration of such can be seen below in figure \@ref(fig:step2). The manip var is highlighted, while the depths of the other variables are not depicted. 

(ref:step2-cap) Manipulation space for controlling the contribution of `aede2` of standardized flea data. Basis selected by a holes-index guided tour. The Projection plane is shown in blue. The manipulation axis, in red, allows the coefficients of the manip var to be changed.

```{r step2, echo=F, out.width='100%', fig.cap = "(ref:step2-cap)"}
#=== Step 2 output
view_manip_space(basis = f_bas, manip_var = f_mvar, labels = colnames(f_dat)) +
    theme(panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill = NA))
```

The representation in \@ref(fig:step2) can be duplicated by calling the function `view_manip_space()`.


### Step 3) Generate rotation

<!-- illustration of axis manip -->
Imagine holding the red axis it is fixed to the origin. As it is manipulated the projection back onto the projection plane correspondingly moves. This is what happens in a manual tour. For a radial tour, fix $\theta$, the angle within the blue plane, and vary the sequence of $\phi$, the angle coming out of the projection plane. Conceptually, live manipulation on a 2D plane allows the user to dynamically control these angles, effectively changing the coefficients of the manip var, which then performs a constrained rotation on the remaining variables.

<!-- describe manip var path -->
For the demonstration of the radial tour, we define a sequence for $\phi$ that brings the initial contribution of the manip var to be maximized and then zeroed before returning to the initial position. 

**For ** $i$ **in 1 to n_slides:**
<!-- don't mix rmd and latex... -->

Post-multiply the manipulation space by the pre-defined rotation matrix producing **RM**, the rotated manip space.

Let:
\begin{description}
  \item[$c_\theta$] be the cosine of $\theta$
  \item[$c_\phi$]   be the cosine of $\phi$
  \item[$s_\theta$] be the sine of   $\theta$
  \item[$s_\phi$]   be the sine of   $\phi$
\end{description}

then
\begin{align*}
  \textbf{RM}_{[p,~3,~i]}
  &= \textbf{M}_{[p,~3]} ~*~ \textbf{R}_{[3,~3]} \\
  &= \begin{bmatrix}
    M_{1,~1} & M_{1,~2} & M_{1,~3} \\
    M_{2,~1} & M_{2,~2} & M_{2,~3} \\
    \vdots   & \vdots   \\
    M_{p,~1} & M_{p,~2} & M_{p,~3}
  \end{bmatrix}_{[p,~3]}
    ~*~
  \begin{bmatrix}
    c_\theta^2 c_\phi s_\theta^2 &
    -c_\theta s_\theta (1 - c_\phi) &
    -c_\theta s_\phi \\
    -c_\theta s_\theta (1 - c_\phi) &
    s_\theta^2 c_\phi + c_\theta^2 &
    -s_\theta s_\phi \\
    c_\theta s_\phi &
    s_\theta s_\phi &
    c_\phi
  \end{bmatrix}_{[3,~3]}
\end{align*}

<!--  phi transform and application note -->
A note on application: compile the sequence of $\phi_i$ and create an array/long table for each rotated manipulation space. $\phi$ is the angle relative to the initial value of $\phi$, we find the transformation $\phi_i$ - $\phi_1$ useful to think about $\phi$ relative to the basis plane. Additionally, the value of $\phi$ may be offset by a factor of pi. If the manip variable doesn't move as expected these are the first places to check.

```{r STEP3CODEEXAMPLE, eval=F, echo=T}
for (phi in seq(seq_start, seq_end, phi_inc_sign)) {
  slide <- slide + 1
  tour[,, slide] <- rotate_manip_space(manip_space, theta, phi)[, 1:2]
}
```

<!-- description of slides, on the technical side we haven't gone back to data space yet. -->
Figure \@ref(fig:step3) illustrates a sequence with 15 projected bases and highlight the manip variable on top while showing the corresponding projected data points on the bottom. Take note of how the changes in the manip var change the distance between the purple and green cluster of points, `aede2` is crucial in distinguishing between these groups. Tours are typically viewed as an animation such a dynamic version of this tour can be viewed online at https://nspyrison.netlify.com/thesis/flea_manualtour_mvar5/. The page may take a moment to load. The format of this figure and linking to an HTML animation will be used again in the Application, section \ref{sec:application}.

## Display projection sequence {#sec:display}

To get back to data-space pre-multiply each rotated manip space by the data for the projection in data-space.

\begin{align}
  \textbf{P}_{[n,~3]}
    &= \textbf{X}_{[n,~p]} ~*~ \textbf{RM}_{[p,~3]} \\
    &=
      \begin{bmatrix}
          X_{1,~1} & \dots & X_{1,~p} \\
          X_{2,~1} & \dots & X_{2,~p} \\
          \vdots   & \vdots & \vdots  \\
          X_{n,~1} & \dots & X_{n,~p}
      \end{bmatrix}_{[n,~p]}
      ~*~
      \begin{bmatrix}
        RM_{1,~1} & RM_{1,~2} & RM_{1,~3} \\
        RM_{2,~1} & RM_{2,~2} & RM_{2,~3} \\
        \vdots     & \vdots     & \vdots     \\
        RM_{p,~1} & RM_{p,~2} & RM_{p,~3}
      \end{bmatrix}_{[p,~d+1]}
\end{align}

Plot the first 2 variables from each projection in sequence for an $XY$ scatterplot. The remaining variable is sometimes linked to a data point aesthetic to produce depth cues used in conjunction with the $XY$ scatterplot.

*tourr* utilizes R's base graphics for the display of tours. Use `render_plotly()` to display as an dynamic `plotly` @sievert_plotly_2018 object or `render_gganimate()` for a `gganimate` @pedersen_gganimate:_2019 graphic. Both of which build from `ggplot2` plotting in internal functions.

Interaction with graphics in R is limited. Traditionally, all commands are passed to the R via calls to the console, conflicting with user engagement. Some recent packages have made advancement into this direction such as with the use of the R package `shiny` [@chang_shiny:_2018], which allows applications can be hosted either locally or remotely and communicate with the R console, allowing for developers to code dynamic content interaction. To a lesser extent, `plotly` offers static interactions with the contained object, such as tooltips, brushing, and linking without communicating back to the R console.


### Storage and sharing

Storing each data point for every frame of the animation is very inefficient. In the same way that we gain efficiency by performing math on the bases, that is the same approach suggested for storage and sharing tours. Consider a radial manual tour, we can store the salient features in 3 bases, where $\phi$ is at its starting, minimum, and maximum values. The frames in between can be interpolated by supplying angular speed. By using the function `tourr::save_history()` we can do just that. Save such tour path history and a single set of data offers performant storage and transfer.


## Application {#sec:application}

In a recent paper, @wang_visualizing_2018, the authors aggregate and visualize the sensitivity of hadronic experiments, in the field of high energy physics. The authors introduce a new tool, PDFSense, to aid in the visualization of Parton distribution functions (PDF). The parameter-space of these experiments lies in 56 dimensions, $\delta \in \mathbb{R}^{56}$, and are presented in as 2D subspaces of the 6 and 10 first principal components in linear and non-linear embeddings.

The work in @cook_dynamical_2018 applies manual tours to discern the finer structure of this sensitivity. Table 1 of Cook et. al. summaries the key findings of PDFSense & TFEP (TensorFlow embedded projections) and those from manual tours. The authors selected the 6 first principal components, containing 48% of the variation held within the full data when centered, but not sphered. This data contained 3 clusters: jet, DIS, and VBP. The initial basis sets used below are obtained from projections used in figures 7 and 8 of the previous study (jet and DIS clusters respectively) of the previous study and apply manual tours to explore the local structure with finer precision.

### Jet cluster

The jet cluster is of interest as it contains the largest data sets and is found to be important in @wang_visualizing_2018. The jet cluster resides in a smaller dimensionality than the full set of experiments with 4 principal components explaining 95% of its variation [@cook_dynamical_2018]. We subset the data down to ATLAS7old and ATLAS7new to narrow in on 2 groups with a reasonable number of observations and occupy different parts of the subspace. Below, we perform radial manual tours on various principal components within this scope. In PC3 and PC4 are manipulated in figure \@ref(fig:JetClusterGood) and figure \@ref(fig:JetClusterBad) respectively. Manipulating PC3, where varying the angle of rotation brings interesting features into and out of the center mass of the data, is more interesting than the manipulation of PC4, where the features are mostly independent of the contribution of PC4.

(ref:JetClusterGood-cap) Jet cluster, a radial manual tour of PC3. Colored by experiment type: 'ATLAS7new' in green and 'ATLAS7old' in orange. When PC3 fully contributes to the projection ATLAS7new (green) occupies unique space and several outliers are identifiable. Zeroing the contribution from PC3 to the projection hides the outliers and indeed all observations with ATLAS7new are contained within ATLAS7old (orange).

### DIS cluster

We perform a manual tour on this data, manipulating PC6 as depicted in figure \@ref(fig:DISclusterGood). Looking at several frames we see that DIS HERA data lies mostly on a plane. When PC6 has full contributions, we see the dimuon SIDIS in purple is almost orthogonal to the DIS HERA (green). Yet the contribution of PC6 has zeroed the dimuon SIDIS data occupy the same space as the DIS HERA data. A dynamic version of this manual tour can be found at:

(ref:DISclusterGood-cap) DIS cluster, a radial manual tour of PC6. colored by experiment type: ‘DIS HERA1+2’ in green, 'dimuon SIDIS' in purple, and 'charm SIDIS' in orange. When the contribution PC 6 is large we see that dimuon SIDIS (purple) data are nearly orthogonal to DIS HERA (green) data. As the projection is rotated, we can also see that DIS HERA (green) practically lies on a plane in this 6-d subspace. When the contribution of PC6 is near zero, dimonSIDIS (purple) occupies the same space as the DIS HERA data. A dynamic version can be viewed at https://nspyrison.netlify.com/thesis/discluster_manualtour_pc6/.

The selection of the correct manip variable is important as the manipulation spaces convey different information. For example, in figure \@ref(fig:DISclusterBad) we select PC2 as the manip variable finding it to be less insightful than PC6.

(ref:DISclusterBad-cap) DIS cluster, a radial manual tour of PC2. Colored by experiment type: ‘DIS HERA1+2’ in green, 'dimuon SIDIS' in purple, and 'charm SIDIS' in orange. The structure of previously described plane of DIS HERA (green) and nearly orthogonal dimuon SIDIS (purple) is present, however, the manipulating PC2 does not give a head-on view of either, a less useful manual tour than that of PC6.

## Discussion {#sec:discussion}

This research has modified the algorithm producing manual tours in extends animations of tours to other graphics packages. Tour paths generated in `tourr` can also be viewed using these frameworks.

Future research on the algorithm would include extending it for use in 3D projections. This would allow for projections in immersive virtual reality, which may allow for a better perception of structure and enable function visualization. The `tourr` package provides many other geometric displays with the `tourr::display_*()` family. These other geoms should be integrated into the `ggplot2` framework for display on `plotly` and `gganimate`.

The Givens rotations and Householder reflections as outlined in @buja_computational_2005 could also be added. Currently, Gram-Schmidt is the only form of frame interpolation used. In a Givens rotation, the $x$ and $y$ components (for example $\theta~= 0,~pi/2$) of the in-plane rotation are calculated separately and would be applied sequentially to produce the radial rotation. Householder reflections define reflection axes to project points on to the axes and generate rotations.

The development of a dynamic graphical user interface, perhaps with the use of a `shiny` app, would allow analysts to rapidly try manual tours with a more intuitive interaction than the command line. The user could easily switch between variables to control, adjust the step size to make smoother rotation sequences, or save any state to continue to explore the contributions of other variables. The `animation` package @xie_animation:_2018 could be implemented for another graphics framework. However, `animation` builds from base graphs while `spinifex` current utilizes `ggplot2` graphics.
