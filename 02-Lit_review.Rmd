## Touring {#sec:tour}

### Overview

In univariate data sets histograms, or smoothed density curves are employed to visualize data. In bivariate data scatterplots and contour plots (2-d density) can be employed. In three dimensions the two most common techniques are: 2-d scatter plot with the 3rd variable as an aesthetic (such as, color, size, height, $etc.$) or rendering the data in a 3-d volume using some perceptive cues giving information describing the seeming depth of the image \footnote{Graphs of data depicting 3 dimension are typically printed on paper, or rendered on a 2-d monitor, they are intrinsically 2-d images. They are sometimes referred to as 2.5-d, or more frequently erroneously referred to as 3-d, more on this later.}. When there are 4 variables: 3 variables as spatial-dimensions and a 4th as aesthetic, or a scatterplot matrix consisting of 4 histograms, and 6 unique combinations of bivariate scatterplots. 

Let $p$ be the number of numeric variables; how do we visualize data for even modest values of $p$ (say 6 or 12)? It's far too common that visualizing in data-space is dropped altogether in favor of modeling parameter-space, model-space, or worse: long tables of statistics without visuals [@wickham_visualizing_2015]. Yet, we all know of the risks inherent in relying too heavily on parameters alone [@anscombe_graphs_1973; @matejka_same_2017]. So why do we move away from visualizing in data-space? Scalability, in a word, we are not familiar with methods that allow us to concisely depict and digest $p \geq 5$ or so dimensions. This is where dimensionality reduction comes in. Specifically, we will be focusing on a specific group called touring. In the interest of time I will not belabor the diversity of dimensionality reduction, (see [@grinstein_high-dimensional_2002; @carreira-perpinan_review_1997; heer_tour_2010] for a quick summary). Suffice it to say that touring has a couple of salient features: linear transformations such that we can interpolate back to the original variable space and does not discard dimensions, something that is common to other linear techniques. By employing the breadth of tours we are able to preserve the visualization of data-space, and with it, the intrinsic understanding of structure and distribution of data that is more succinct or beyond the reach of statistic values alone.

Touring is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that orthogonally projects $p$-space down to $d(\leq p)$ dimensions. Many such projections are interpolated, each making rotations in $p$-space. These frames are then viewed in order as an animation of the lower dimensional embedding changing as the orginial variable space manipulated. Shadow puppets offer a useful analogy to aid in conceptualizing touring. Imagine a fixed light source facing a wall. When a hand or puppet is introduced the 3-dimensional object projects a 2-dimensional shadow onto the wall. This is a physical representation of a simple projection, that from $p=3$ down to $d=2$. If the object rotates then the shadow correspondingly changes. Observers watching only the shadow are functionally watching a 2-dimensional tour as the 3-dimensional object is manipulated. In some views more information is hidden than in others, and complex strutures generally require more time to comphrehend the nature of the geometry.


#### Terminology

Terminology varies accross author and implementation. In my work, I use the following

* $n$, numerber of observations
* $p$, number of numeric variables, the dimensionality of data space,
* $d$, dimensionality of projection space
* $\textbf{X}_{[n,~p]}$, a data matrix in variable-space, $\textbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$. Typically centered, scaled, and optionally sphered.
* $B_{[p,~d]}$, orthonormal basis vector, defining the orientation of projection from $p-$ to $d-$space
* $\textbf{Y}_{[n,~d]}$, projected data matrix in projection-space, $\textbf{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$

* For projections down to 1- and 2-d, It's common to display the contribution and direction on it's own axis (1d) or relative to a unit circle (2d), this is sometime refered to as basis axes or a reference frame.
* Geometric objects are referred to in generalized dimensions; the use of plane isn't necessarily a 2d surface, but a hyperplane in the arbitary dimensions of the projection space.
    

### History

Touring was first introduced by Asimov in 1985 with his purposed Grand Tour[@asimov_grand_1985] at the Stanford Linear Accelerator, Stanford University. In which, Asimov suggested three types of grand tours: torus, at-random, and random-walk. The specifics of which will be discussed below in the Typology section. The original application of touring was on high energy physics on the PRIM-9 system.

Before choosing projection paths randomly, an exhaustive search of was suggested by @mcdonald_interactive_1982, also at the Stanford Linear Accelerator, and acknowledges Asimov and Buja.

In 1974 Friedman and Tukey purposed Projection Pursuit[@friedman_projection_1974] (sometimes referred to as PP) while working at Bell Labs. Projection Pursuit involves identifying "interesting" projection, remove a single component of the data, and then iterate in this newly embedded subspace. Within each subspace the projection seeks for a local extrema via hill climbing algorithms. This formed the basis for guided tours @hurley_analyzing_1990, 

<!-- * torus: where a $p$-dimensional torus, $T^p$ is created from a Cartesian product of $p$ unit circles with $T^p \in \mathbb{R}^p$. Unfortunately, uniformity of the parameters does not correlate to uniform points on the surface of the torus. If step distance between frames is fixed, disproportionate time is spent between subspaces. If step distance is change to account for uniform points on the torus then the continuity of the tour is lost.   -->
<!-- * at-random: where each 2-frame is chosen at random without replacement. This affords an assured uniform distribution of subspaces but is far too discontinuous for observation. It also leaves no parameters to control. -->
<!-- * random-walk: combines the continuity of the torus method and the uniformity of the at-random method while leaving room for a control parameter.  -->

The grand and little tour have no input from the user aside from the starting basis. Purjection Pusuit allows for an index to be selected, but the bulk of touring development since has largely been around dynamic display, user interaction, geometric representation, and application. The extent to which will be expounded on in the following sections.

### Path genration

A fundamental aspect of touring is the path of rotation. Of which there are four primary distinctions[@buja_computational_2005]: random choice, precomputed choice, data driven, and manual control.

* *grand tour*, a constrained random choice $p$-space. Paths are constrained for changes in direction small enough to maintain continuity and aid in user comprehension
    + torus-surface [@asimov_grand_1985]
    + at-random
    + random-walk
    + *local tour*, a sort of grand tour on a leash, such that it goes to a nearby random projection before returning to the original position and iterating
* *guided tour*, data driven tour that optimizing some objective function via projection pursuit[@hurley_analyzing_1990], analogous to gradient descent.
    + holes [@cook_projection_1993] - iterates projections that add more white space to the center of the projection.
    + cmass [@cook_projection_1993] - find the projection with the most density or mass in the center.
    + lda [@lee_projection_2005] - linear discriminant analysis, seeks a projection where 2 or more classes are most separated.
    + pda - principal component analysis finding where the data is most spread (1d only).
    + convex [@laa_using_2019] - the ratio of area of convex and alpha hulls.
    + skinny [@laa_using_2019] - the ratio of of the perimeter distance to the area of the alpha hull.
    + stringy [@laa_using_2019] - based on the minimum spanning tree (MST), the diameter of the MST over the length of the (MST).
    + dcor2D [@grimm_mbgraphic:_2017; @laa_using_2019] - distance correlation that finds linear and non-linear dependancyes between variables.
    + splines2D [@grimm_mbgraphic:_2017; @laa_using_2019] - measure of non-linear dependence by fitting spline models.
    + other user-defined objective function can be implemented with the *tourr* package @wickham_tourr_2011.
* *planned tour*, Precomputed choice, in which the path has already been generated or defined.
    + *little tour* [@mcdonald_interactive_1982], where every permutation of variables is stepped through in order, analogous to a brute-force or exhaustive search.
    + a saved path of any other tour, typically an array of basis targets to interpolate between as produced by the R function `tourr::save_history()`.
* *manual tour* - Manual control, a constrained rotation on selected manipulation variable and magnitude[@cook_manual_1997]. Typically used to explore the local area after identifying an interesting feature from another tour.
* *dependence tour*, combination of $n$ independent 1d tours. A vector describes the axis each variable will be displayed on. **ie** $c(1, 1, 2, 2)$ is a 4 to 2d tour with the first 2 variables on the first axis, and the remaining on the second.
    + *correlation tour* [@buja_data_1987], a special case of the dependence tour, analogous to canonical correlation analysis

#### Tour path evaluation 

Consider $d=2$, then each projection is called a 2-frame (each spanning a 2-plane). Mathematically we call the set of all possible unoriented 2-frames in $p$-space a Grassmannian, $\textbf{Gr}(2,~p)$. @asimov_grand_1985 pointed out that the unique 2-frames of the grand tour approaches $\textbf{Gr}(2,~p)$ as time goes to infinity. We could then define the *density* of a tour as the fraction of the Grassmannian explored. Ideally a grand tour will be dense, but the time taken to become dense vastly increases as variable space increase dimensionality. We could then also talk about the *rapidity* of a tour as how quickly a tour encompasses the Grassmannian. Due to the random selection of a grand tour it will end up visiting homomorphisms of previous 2-frames, sub-optimal rapidity. 

The little tour introduced in @mcdonald_interactive_1982, on the the other hand is necessarily both dense and rapid, performing essentially an exhaustive search on the Grassmannian. However the path choosen is uninteresting, the pre-defined sequence rarely results in insightful observations.

Guided tours (@hurley_analyzing_1990) optimize an ojective functionm generating path will be relatively small subset of the Grassmanian, density and rapidity become poor measures, while interesting projections are quickly identified. Recently, @laa_using_2019, compares projection pursuit indices with the metrics: smoothness, squintability, flexibility, rotation invariance and speed. See the original work to see how the indices perform.


### Geom display dimensionality

Up to this point we have been talking about 2d scatterplots, which offer the first and a simple case for viewing lower-dimensional embeddings of $p$-space. However, other geometrics (or geoms) offer perfectly valid orthonormal projections as well.

* 1d geoms
    + 1-d densities: such as histogram, average shifted histograms[@scott85], and kernel density[@scott95].
    + image: [@Wegman 2001]
    + time series: where multivariate values are independently lagged to view peak and trough alignment. Currently no package implementation, but use case is discussed in [@cook_manual_1997]. 
* 2d geoms
    + 2-d density (available on Github at https://github.com/nspyrison/tourr)
    + $x-y$ scatterplot
* 2.5d geoms - these geoms do not perform project to 3 dimensions, but rather give persception cues into the add dimension of the manipulation space of 2d projection.
    + Anaglyphs, sometimes called stereo, where (typically) red images are positioned for the left channel and cyan for the right, when viewed with corresponding filter glasses give the depth perception of the image.
    + Depth, which use some subset of depth cues, most commonly size and/or color of data points.
* $d$-dim geoms
    + Andrews curves [@andrews_plots_1972], smoothed variant of parallel coordinate plots, discussed below. 
    + Chernoff faces [@chernoff_use_1973], variables linked to size of facial features for rapid cursory like-ness comparison of observations.
    + Parallel coordinate plots [@ocagne_coordonnees_1885], where any number of variables are plotted in parallel with observations linked to their corresponding variable value by polylines.
    + Scatterplot matrix [@becker_brushing_1987], showing a triangle matrix of bivariate scatterplots with 1-d density on the diagonal.
    + Radial glyphs, radial variants of parallel coordinates including radar, spider, and star glyphs [@siegel_surgical_1972]. 


### Tour software implementations

Below is a non-exhaustive list of software implementing touring in some degree, ordered by descending year:
<!-- See hadley's thesis and, C2 paper for lists. -->

* spinifex [@spinifex] -- for Linux, Unix, and Windows.
* tourr [@wickham_tourr_2011] -- for Linux, Unix, and Windows. R package.
* CyrstalVision [@wegman_visual_2003] -- for Windows.
* GGobi [@swayne_ggobi:_2003] -- for Linux and Windows.
* DAVIS [@huh_davis:_2002] -- Java based, with GUI.
* VRGobi [@nelson_xgobi_1998] -- for use with the C2, tours in stereoscopic 3d displays.
* ExplorN [@carr_explorn:_1996] -- for SGI Unix.
* XGobi [@swayne_xgobi:_1991] -- for Linux, Unix, and Windows (via emulation).
* XLispStat [@tierney_lisp-stat:_1990] -- for Unix, and Windows.
* Explor4 [@carr_explor4:_1988] -- Four-Dimensional Data Using Stereo-Ray Glyphs
* Prim-9 [@asimov_grand_1985;@fisherkeller_prim-9:_1974] -- on an internal operating system.

Support and maintenance of such implementations give them a particularly short life span, while conceptual abstraction and technically heavier implementations have hampered user growth. There have been notable efforts to diminish the barriers to entry and make touring more approachable as a data exploration tool [@huh_davis:_2002; @swayne_ggobi:_2003; @wegman_visual_2003; @wickham_tourr_2011; huang_tourrgui:_2012].
