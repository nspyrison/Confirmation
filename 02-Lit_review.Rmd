<!-- This chapter contains a summary of the context in which your research is set.  -->

<!-- Imagine you are writing for your fellow PhD students. Topics that are well-known to them do not have to be included here. But things that they may not know about should be included. -->

<!-- Resist the temptation to discuss everything you've read in the last few years. And you are not writing a textbook either. This chapter is meant to provide the background necessary to understand the material in subsequent chapters. Stick to that. -->

<!-- You will need to organize the literature review around themes, and within each theme provide a story explaining the development of ideas to date. In each theme, you should get to the point where your ideas will fit in. But leave your ideas to later chapters. This way it is clear what has been done beforehand, and what new contributions you are making to the research field. -->

## Touring {#sec:tour}

### Overview

In univariate datasets histograms, or smoothed density curves are employed to visualize data. In bivariate data scatterplots and contour plots (2-d density) can be employed. In three dimensions the two most common techniques are: 2-d scatter plot with the 3rd variable as an aesthetic (such as, color, size, height, $etc.$) or rendering the data in a 3-d volume using some perceptive cues giving information describing the seeming depth of the image \footnote{Graphs of data depicting 3 dimension are typically printed on paper, or rendered on a 2-d monitor, they are intrinsically 2-d images. They are sometimes referred to as 2.5-d, or more frequently erroneously referred to as 3-d, more on this later.}. When there are 4 variables: 3 variables as spatial-dimensions and a 4th as aesthetic, or a scatterplot matrix consisting of 4 histograms, and 6 unique combinations of bivariate scatterplots. 

Let $p$ be the number of numeric variables; how do we visualize data for even modest values of $p$ (say 6 or 12)? It's far too common that visualizing in data-space is dropped altogether in favor of modeling parameter-space, model-space, or worse: long tables of statistics without visuals [@wickham_visualizing_2015]. Yet, we all know of the risks inherant in relying too heavily on parameters alone [@anscombe_graphs_1973; @matejka_same_2017]. So why do we move away from visualizing in data-space? Scalability, in a word, we are not familiar with methods that allow us to concisely depict and digest $p \geq 5$ or so dimensions. This is where dimensonality reduction comes in. Specifically, we will be focusing on a specific group called touring. In the interest of time I will not belabor the diversity of dimentionality reduction, (see [@grinstein_high-dimensional_2002; @carreira-perpinan_review_1997; heer_tour_2010] for a quick summary). Suffice it to say that touring has a couple of salient features: linear transfromations such that we can interpolate back to the oiginal variable space and does not discard dimensions, something that is common to other linear techniques. By emploring the bredth of tours we are able to preserve the visualization of data-space, and with it, the intrinsic understanding of structure and distribution of data that is more susinct or beyond the reach of statistic valules alone.

Touring is a linear dimensonality reduction technique that orthagonally projects $p$-space down to $d(\leq p)$ dimensions. Many such projections are interpolated, each making local rotations in $p$-space. These frames are then viewed in order to the effect of watching an animation of the lower dimensional embedding changing as $p$-space is manipulated. Shadow puppets offer a useful analogy to aid in conceptualizing touring. Imagine a fixed light source facing a wall. When a hand or puppet is introduced the 3-dimensional object projects a 2-dimensional shadow onto the wall. This is a physical representation of a simple projection, that from $p=3$ down to $d=2$. If the object rotates then the shadow correspondingly changes. Observers watching only the shadow are functionally watching a 2-dimensional tour as the 3-dimensional object is manipulated.

<!-- Each of the original variables assumes some magnidute and direction in the resulting embedding, as described by a linear combination of the orthonormal basis. We call the view of this linear combination on a unit-circle the 'reference frame'. Reference frames  -->

#### Terminology

n, p (sometimes called d by Wegman, or n ), d (sometimes called k by wegman, or d in tourr)

### History

<!-- In 1974 Friedman and Tukey purposed Projection Pursuit[@friedman_projection_1974] (sometimes referred to as PP) while working at Bell Labs. Projection Pursuit involves identifying "interesting" projection, remove a single component of the data, and then iterate in this newly embedded subspace. Within each subspace the projection seeks for a local extrema via gradient descent (historically referred to as hill climbing algorithms), hence the nomenclature pursuit. -->

Touring was first introduced by Asimov in 1985 with his purposed Grand Tour[@asimov_grand_1985] at Stanford University. In which, Asimov suggested three types of Grand Tours: torus, at-random, and random-walk. The specifics of which will be discussed below in the Typology section.

TALK ABOUT maths Here::



Note that the the above methods have no input from the user aside from the starting basis. The bulk of touring development since has largely been around dynamic display, user interaction, geometric representation, and application. 
<!--above claim from c2 paper: buja & asimov 1986, Hurley & Buja 1990, Wegman 1991, cook, buja, cabrera, & hurley 1995, buja, cook asimov & hurley 1997,cook & buja 1997. -->



This works well when the number of dimensions being toured is small (in the neighborhood of 5-10), yet the number of view, or 2-frames and we can produce from $p$-space suffers from the so called blessing/curse of dimensionality. In which the plethora of degrees of freedom either offer many (non-unique) solutions to a problem or something that becomes ever increasing unlikely, 


### Tour path

A fundamental aspect of touring is the path of rotation. Of which there are four primary distinctions[@buja_computational_2005]: random choice, precomputed choice, data driven, and manual control.

* *grand tour*, a constrained random choice p-space. Paths are constrained for changes in direction small enough to maintain continuity and allow for user comphrehension
    + torus-surface [@asimov_grand_1985]
    + Geodesic 
    + at-random
    + random-walk
    + *local tour*, a sort of grand tour on leash, such that it goes to a nearby random projection before returning to the original position and iterating
* *guided tour*, data driven tour optimiazing some objective function via (stochastic) gradient descent [@hurley_analyzing_1990].
    + holes [@cook_projection_1993] - iterates projections that add more white space to the center of the projection.
    + cmass [@cook_projection_1993] - find the projection with the most density or mass in the center.
    + lda [@lee_projection_2005] - linear discrimin ant analysis, seeks a projection where 2 or more classes are most separated.
    + pda - pricipal component analysis finding where the data is most spread (1d only).
    + other user-defined objective function [@wickham_tourr_2011].
* *planned tour*, Precomputed choice, In which the path has already been generated or defined.
    + *little tour* [@mcdonald_interactive_1982], where every permutation of variables is stepped through in order, analogous to a brute-force or exhaustive search.
    + a saved path of any other tour
* *manual tour* - Manual control, a constrained rotation on selected manipulation variable and magnitude[@cook_manual_1997]. Typically used to explore the local area after identifying an interesting feature from another tour.

* *dependance tour*, combination of $n$ independent 1d tours. A vector describes the axis each variable will be displayed on. **ie** $c(1, 1, 2, 2)$ is a 4 to 2d tour with the first 2 variables on on the first axis, and the remaining on the second.  
    + *correlation tour* [@buja_data_1987], a special case of the dependance tour, analogous to canonical correlation analysis

<!-- ... -->
<!-- * torus: where a $p$-dimensional torus, $T^p$ is created from a Cartesian product of $p$ unit circles with $T^p \in \mathbb{R}^p$. Unfortunately uniformity of the parameters do not correlate to uniform points on the surface of the torus. If step distance between frames is fixed, disproportionate time is spent between subspaces. If step distance is change to account for uniform points on the torus then the continuity of the tour is lost.   -->
<!-- * at-random: where each 2-frame is chosen at random without replacement. This affords an assured uniform distribution of subspaces, but is far to discontinuous for observation. It also leaves no parameters to control. -->
<!-- * random-walk: combines the continuity of the torus method and the uniformity of the at-random method while leaving room for a control parameter.  -->


### Geometrics and display dimension

Up to this point we have been talking about 2d scatterplots, which offer the first and a simple case for viewing lower-dimensional embeddings of $p$-space. However, other geometrics (or geoms) offer perfectly valid orthonormal projections as well.

* 1d geoms
    + 1-d densities: such as histogram, average shifted histograms[@scott85], and kernal density[@scott95].
    + image: [@Wegman 2001]
    + time series: where multivariate values are independantly lagged to view peak and trough allignment. Currently no package implementation, but use case is discussed in [@cook_manual_1997]. 
* 2d geoms
    + 2-d density [@NS GITHUB]
    + scatterplot
    +
* 2.5d, 3d geoms {ADD FOOTNOTE ABOUT 2.5d vs 3d}
    + Anaglyphs, sometimes called stero, where (typically) red images are positioned for the left channel and cyan for the right, when viewed with corresponding filter glasses give the depth perception of the image.
    + Depth, which use some subset of depth cues, most commonly size and/or color of data points.
* $d$-dim geoms
    + Andrews crurves [@andrews_plots_1972], smoothed variant of parallel coordinate plots, discussed below. 
    + Chernoff faces [@chernoff_use_1973], variables linked to size of facial features for rapid cursory like-ness comparison of observations.
    + Parallel coordinate plots [@ocagne_coordonnees_1885], where any number of variables are ploted in parallel with observations linked to their cooresponding variable value by polylines.
    + Scatterplot matrix [@becker_brushing_1987], showing a triangle matrix of bivariate scatterplots with 1-d density on the diagonal.
    + Radial glyphs, radial variants of parallel coordinates including radar, spider, and star glyphs [@siegel_surgical_1972]. 


### Aplication

Below is a non-exhaustive list of software implementing touring in some degree, ordered by descending year:
<!-- See hadley's thesis and, C2 paper for lists. -->

* Spinifex [@spinifex] -- for Linux, Unix, and Windows.
* Tourr [@wickham_tourr_2011] -- for Linux, Unix, and Windows. R package.
* CyrstalVision [@wegman_visual_2003] -- for Windows.
* GGobi [@swayne_ggobi:_2003] -- for Linux and Windows.
* DAVIS [@huh_davis:_2002] -- Java based, with GUI.
* VRGobi [@nelson_xgobi_1998] -- for use with the C2 in steroscopic 3d displays.
* ExplorN [@carr_explorn:_1996] -- for SGI Unix.
* XGobi [@swayne_xgobi:_1991] -- for Linux, Unix, and Windows (via emulation).
* XLispStat [@tierney_lisp-stat:_1990] -- for Unix, and Windows.
* Prim-9 [@asimov_grand_1985;@fisherkeller_prim-9:_1974] -- on an internal operating system.

Support and maintenance of such implementations give them a particularly short life span, while conceptual abscraction and technically heavier implementations have hampered user growth. There have been notable efforts to deminish the barriers to entry and make touring more approachable as a data exploration tool [@huh_davis:_2002; @swayne_ggobi:_2003; @wegman_visual_2003; @wickham_tourr_2011; huang_tourrgui:_2012].
