<!-- # Abstract {-} -->

<!-- Visualizing data space is crucial to exploratory data analysis yet doing so quickly becomes difficult as the dimensionality of the data increases. Traditionally, static, low-dimensional linear embeddings are used. Observing one such embedding often misses a significant amount of variation, and hence, information held within the data. Touring is a method that animates many projections as the orientation in data space is varied. This maintains transparency to the original variables, while preserving information in the data. -->

<!-- There are various ways to generate tour paths and many geometrics to view each path. Once an interesting feature has been identified there is need for finer control to explore the local sturture, in particular through User Controled Steering (UCS). -->

<!-- I have implemented manual tours in the programming language R with compatibility to the other touring package while extending to new graphics paradigms to display tours. The application of manual tours to experimental high energy physics data that exists in 56-dimensional space is also presented extending previous touring on the same data. -->
