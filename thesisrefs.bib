	abstract = {Projections of high-dimensional data onto low-dimensional subspaces provide insightful views for understanding multivariate relationships. This article discusses how to manually control the variable contributions to the projection. The user has control of the way a particular variable contributes to the viewed projection and can interactively adjust the variable's contribution. These manual controls complement the automatic views provided by a grand tour, or a guided tour, and give greatly improved flexibility to data analysts.},

Three-dimensional point cloud rotations provide the canonical example of the applications of motion graphics to data analysis. Similarly, motion may be used to good effect to explore data of arbitrarily high dimension. This will be demonstrated by describing how a data analyst guides a projection plane as it moves through high-dimensional data space.},
