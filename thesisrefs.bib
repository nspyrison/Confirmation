This paper proposes three strategies for visualizing statistical models: (1) display the model in the data space, (2) look at all members of a collection, and (3) explore the process of model ﬁtting, not just the end result. Each strategy is accompanied by examples, including manova, classiﬁcation algorithms, hierarchical clustering, ensembles of linear models, projection pursuit, self organizing maps and neural networks.},

The projected data can be rendered as densities or histograms, scatterplots, anaglyphs, glyphs, scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinate plots, time series or images, and viewed using an R graphics device, passed to GGobi, or saved to disk. A tour path can be stored for visualisation or replay. With this package it is possible to quickly experiment with diﬀerent, and new, approaches to tours of data.

This paper presents a novel method for generating such datasets, along with several examples. Our technique varies from previous approaches in that new datasets are iteratively generated from a seed dataset through random perturbations of individual data points, and can be directed towards a desired outcome through a simulated annealing optimization strategy. Our method has the beneﬁt of being agnostic to the particular statistical properties that are to remain constant between the datasets, and allows for control over the graphical appearance of resulting output.},

Perhaps the biggest advance is that GGobi can be easily extended, either by being embedded in other software or by the addition of plugins; either way, it can be controlled using an Application Programming Interface. An illustration of its extensibility is that it can be embedded in R. The result is a full marriage between GGobi's direct manipulation graphical environment and R's familiar extensible environment for statistical data analysis.},

However, data mining strategies are often applied to massive data sets where visualization may not be very successful because of the limits of both screen resolution, human visual system resolution as well as the limits of available computational resources. In this paper I suggest some strategies for overcoming such limitations and illustrate visual data mining with some examples of successful attacks on high-dimensional and large data sets.
